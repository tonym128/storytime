He knew it was going to rain soon.Tweety flew to his friend, a little mouse named Jerry, and told him about the cloud. "Jerry, we need to find a safe place to hide from the rain," Tweety said. "I know just the place," Jerry replied. He led Tweety to a tree with a big hole in it. "We'll go in here," Jerry said.As they crawled inside the tree, they heard someone whispering orders. It was the squirrel, Mr. Nutty. "You must stay here until the rain stops," he said. "No, we can't," Tweety said. "The rain is harmless and we need to stay safe." Then they listened to the squirrel's orders and waited until the rain stopped.

Lily's mom quickly grabbed her and ran inside the house. They were both covered in the smelly skunk spray and had to take a bath to get clean.After their bath, Lily's mom told her a story about a girl who tried to pull out a whole herb with a strong breath, but it didn't work and only blew out the skunk's smelly spray.

Timmy loved to play outside in the grass and pick flowers. One day, he saw a little fairy sitting on a flower."Hello, fairy!" said Timmy."Hello, little boy," said the fairy. "I'm here to help you.""How can you help me?" asked Timmy."I can make you wealthy," said the fairy. "But you must promise to share your flowers with others."Timmy agreed and the fairy sprinkled some dust on his flowers. Suddenly, Timmy's flowers grew bigger and bigger until he had as many as a car!But then, something unexpected happened. A big gust of wind blew all of Timmy's flowers away.
