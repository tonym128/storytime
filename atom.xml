She would collect them and build little houses for them. One day, she found a shiny rock that she really liked. She showed it to her friend, Timmy, and said, "Look at my pretty rock!"Timmy looked at the rock and said, "That's a nice rock, but it's not as valuable as your other rocks."Lily didn't understand what he meant, so she asked, "What do you mean?"Timmy replied, "It means someone may say your rock is worth a lot of money."Lily felt sad and didn't want her rock to be worth a lot of money. She decided to bury it in a deep hole so no one could take it. But when she finished burying it, she realized she had lost something very important in the screw she was carrying. She became very upset and cried. Her friends tried to help her find it, but it was impossible.

So, Lily and Timmy helped the bird decorate its nest with pretty flowers and shiny stars. The bird was so happy that it gave them a ride on its back to catch the star. They reached the star and brought it back to the bird's nest. The bird was so grateful that it gave them a ride back home. From that day on, Lily and Timmy always looked up at the stars and remembered their friendly bird friend.</content><link href="https://ttech.mamacos.media/storytime/post/2023/08/14/once-upon-a-time,-there-was-a-little-girl-named-lily.html" rel="alternate"/><link href="https://ttech.mamacos.media/storytime/post/2023/08/14/once-upon-a-time,-there-was-a-little-girl-named-lily.html" rel="self"/><link href="https://github.com/tonym128/storytime/raw/main/media/2023-08-14-once-upon-a-time,-there-was-a-little-girl-named-lily.txt.mp3" rel="enclosure" type="audio/mpeg"/></entry><entry><id>https://github.com/tonym128/storytime/raw/main/media/2023-08-14-once-upon-a-time,-there-was-a-little-boy-named-timmy.txt.mp3</id><title>2023-08-14 - Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy</title><updated>2023-08-22T07:10:08.231588+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Mamacos</name><email>tmamacos@gmail.com</email></author><content>Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy.
