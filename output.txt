 Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very curious and loved to explore. One day, she went for a walk in the park and found a big tunnel. She felt excited and decided to go inside.
As she walked through the tunnel, she saw many different animals like birds, rabbits, and squirrels. They all looked happy and friendly. Lily felt a little bit unsure, but decided to keep going.
Suddenly, she heard a loud noise and felt herself falling. She was scared and didn't know what to do. But then, a kind lady approached her and helped her back up. Lily felt relieved and grateful. She learned that sometimes it's okay to be curious, but it's also important to ask for help when you need it.
