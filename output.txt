Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim was very restless. He wanted to play all day long. One day, Tim's mom took him to a big place where many people were eating and talking. This place was called a restaurant.
Tim's mom said, "Tim, we need to eat at this restaurant to stay strong and healthy." Tim did not want to listen. He wanted to play with his friends. But his mom insisted that they go inside the restaurant.
At the restaurant, Tim saw a big plate of yummy food. He ate and ate, and soon, he felt happy and full. Tim's mom was right. He felt strong and healthy. After they finished eating, Tim went outside to play with his friends. Now, when Tim felt restless, he knew it was time to eat and have fun.
