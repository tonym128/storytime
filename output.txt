Once upon a time, there was a chubby cat named Tom. Tom loved to play outside and rock on his bike. He would go from the front seat to the back, laughing and having fun.
One day, Tom saw a big cross on the ground. He was very curious and wanted to know what it was. He climbed down from his bike and walked up to the cross. It was made of sticks, so he couldn't see the end.
Tom felt a little tired from all the rocking on his bike ride. He decided to sit on the cross and rest for a bit. As he sat there, he saw a butterfly fly by. Tom chased the butterfly and had a great time. When he was ready to go home, he hopped back on his bike and rode back home, excited to tell his friends about the cross and the butterfly.
