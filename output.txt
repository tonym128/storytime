Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to watch the parade that came to his town every year. He would wave at all the people and animals as the big trucks walked by.
One day, Timmy went to the parade with his mom. They found a good spot to sit and watch. Suddenly, Timmy realized he had lost his favorite toy truck. He looked everywhere, but he couldn't find it.
Timmy started to cry and his mom asked him what was wrong. Timmy said, "I lost my truck! I can't find it anywhere!" His mom hugged him and said, "Don't worry, we'll look for it together. And we'll find it on the next parade." Timmy felt happy again and they continued watching the parade.
