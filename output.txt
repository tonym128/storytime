Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to explore the forest and find new things. One day, she found a shiny rock that she thought was very pretty. She showed it to her friend, a talking bunny named Benny.
Benny said, "That's a mineral, Lily. It's very special and valuable." Lily was happy to hear that and put the mineral in her pocket.
As they were walking, they saw a big, scary bear. Benny said, "We need to be careful, Lily. Bears can be dangerous." Lily was scared, but she remembered that she had a secret weapon. She reached into her pocket and took out the mineral.
She held it up and said, "I have this mineral. It's magical and will protect us." Suddenly, the mineral began to glow and shake. The bear was scared and ran away.
Lily and Benny were amazed. They had never seen anything like it before. Lily looked at the mineral and said, "I guess this is truly special. Let's keep it safe." From that day
