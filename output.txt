Once upon a time, there was a weak fish. The weak fish lived in the sea. It was not strong like the other fish. The weak fish had a dream. It wanted to be big and strong.
One day, the weak fish met a big fish. The big fish was strong. The weak fish asked the big fish, "How can I be big and strong like you?" The big fish said, "You must eat a lot of food and swim every day."
The weak fish listened to the big fish. It ate a lot of food and swam every day. The weak fish became stronger. It was not weak anymore. The weak fish was now a big and strong fish. The big fish and the big fish became friends. They swam together in the sea, happy and strong.
