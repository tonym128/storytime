Once upon a time, there was a little mouse named Timmy. Timmy was very small and had a weak tail. He lived in a cozy hole in the wall of a big house. One day, Timmy heard a loud noise outside his hole. He peeked out and saw a big, scary cat staring at him. 
Timmy knew he had to be brave and find a way to escape from the cat. He remembered his weak tail and decided to use it to climb up a nearby tree. The cat tried to climb the tree too, but it was too weak and couldn't make it up. 
Timmy was safe in the tree and he realized that even though his tail was weak, he was also very clever. From that day on, he always kept an eye out for danger and used his tail to defend himself. And whenever he saw a cat staring at him, he knew he just had to be brave and find a way to escape.
