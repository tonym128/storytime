Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the garden and look at all the animals. One day, she saw a little fox running around. The fox looked sad and Lily felt bad for him.
Lily wanted to make the fox happy, so she decided to provide him with some food. She went inside and got some carrots and apples for the fox. When she came back outside, the fox was gone!
Lily was sad and didn't know what to do. Suddenly, she heard a noise behind her. She turned around and saw the little fox hiding behind a tree. He had been playing a trick on her! Lily was surprised but happy that the fox was okay. From that day on, Lily and the little fox became good friends and played together every day in the garden.
