Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She had a large purse that she loved to carry everywhere. One day, Lily went to the park to play with her friends. While playing, she saw a butterfly and tried to catch it. But the butterfly flew away and she couldn't catch it.
Lily's friend, Sarah, saw her struggle and said, "I have an idea! Let's make a butterfly net with a stick and a piece of cloth." Lily was happy and they quickly made the net together. They went back to the park and tried using their new net. After a few tries, they finally caught the butterfly. Lily was so happy that she could hardly contain herself. She said, "Thank you, Sarah! You helped me catch the butterfly!"
