Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim liked to pack his toy truck with blocks. He wanted to build a very tall tower. Tim tried and tried, but it was not easy.
One day, Tim found a magic toy car. The car had the power to make the tower easy to build. Tim asked the magic car to help him. The car said, "I will help you, but you must promise to share the blocks with me."
Tim agreed, and they built the tower together. The magic car's power made the tower easy to build. Tim was so happy. The magic car kept its promise and shared the blocks with Tim. They played together and had lots of fun. And from that day on, Tim and the magic car were best friends.
