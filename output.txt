Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat fruit, especially apples, bananas, and oranges. One day, her mom took her to the store to buy some fruit. Lily was very excited and asked her mom if they could buy some apples or bananas. Her mom said yes, and they went inside the store.
Lily saw a man who was very successful at selling fruit. He had many different fruits like oranges, grapes, and strawberries. Lily looked at the fruits and said, "Wow, these are all different kinds of fruit, but I want to choose some apples and bananas." Her mom smiled and said, "Okay, let's get some apples and bananas."
Lily was very happy with her choice of fruit. She said to her mom, "I love fruit! Can we eat them now?" Her mom said, "Yes, let's go home and have some fruit together." Lily smiled and said, "Yay, fruit is my favorite!"
