Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot was very tired from playing all day. He wanted to take a nap. He looked for a soft and cozy spot to rest.
Spot found a big pillow on the floor. He thought it was the perfect place to lie down and sleep. But when he tried to lay on the pillow, he felt embarrassed. The pillow was too big for him, and he was not very big.
Spot's friend, a little cat named Whiskers, came over to see what was wrong. Whiskers saw the big pillow and had an idea. She told Spot to lie down and close his eyes. Spot did as Whiskers said, and he felt much better. Now he could sleep on the big, soft pillow, and he was not embarrassed anymore.
