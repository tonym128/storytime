Sam and Lily liked to play pretend. They had a big box that they used as a spaceship. They put on helmets and gloves and said they were going to the moon. They counted down from ten and then zoomed around the room.
Inside the box, they had many things to make their spaceship more fun. They had stickers, crayons, papers, and more. They put their hands in their pockets and took out some gear. They had rockets, aliens, dinosaurs, and more. They used them to decorate the box and make it look cool.
They wanted to show their mom and dad their spaceship. They pushed a button and the box made a loud noise. It started to move up and down and shake. They looked out of a hole and saw stars and moons and planets. They pretended they were flying to different planets and having adventures. They had a generous time with their spaceship. They shared their gear and their stories and their dreams. They were happy and excited.
