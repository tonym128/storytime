Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a generous man named Tom. Tom loved to help people. He always shared his toys and treats with everyone. One day, Tom had an idea to make a big meal for all the people in town.
Tom worked hard to cook the food. He made yummy soup, tasty bread, and sweet cake. He invited all the people in the town to come and eat. Everyone was happy and excited to eat Tom's meal.
While Tom was cooking, a little bird flew into the kitchen. The bird was hungry and wanted to eat the food too. The bird saw the cake and thought it was real. So, the bird tried to bite the cake. But Tom saw the bird and took it outside to find and release it. The bird flew away happily. Everyone at the town enjoyed Tom's generous meal and they all had a great time.
