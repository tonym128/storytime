Once upon a time, there was a family. The family had a dad, a mom, and a little boy named Tim. Tim was a nosy boy. He liked to know what his mom and dad were doing.
One day, Tim saw his mom and dad discuss something. They were talking about whether they should have a new baby. Tim thought it was a big job. He wanted to help with the news.
Tim tried to discuss with his mom and dad. He said, "I think it is good." But they did not listen. They got very mad at each other. They decided not to have a new baby. Tim was sad and lonely without his family.
