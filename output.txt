Once upon a time, in a normal little town, there was a boy named Tim. Tim loved to poke things with his finger. One day, he went to the park with his mom. At the park, he saw a big tree with a hole in it. Tim thought it was a secret place, but he didn't know what was inside.
"Mom, what's in the tree hole?" Tim asked. His mom didn't know, so she said, "I don't know, Tim. Maybe we can find out later. But first, let's play on the swings." Tim played on the swings, but he still wanted to know what was in the tree hole.
Later, when it was time to go home, Tim and his mom walked to the tree hole. Tim poked the hole with his finger. Suddenly, a small squirrel jumped out! Tim was so surprised. The squirrel looked at Tim and said, "Thank you for poking the hole. I was stuck inside. I've been waiting for someone to help me get out." Tim and his mom smiled, happy that they had solved the secret of the squirrel.
