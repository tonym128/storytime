Once upon a time, there was a big, gray whale swimming in the ocean. The whale was very tired and needed to rest. So, he swam to a quiet place and lay down on a big rock. 
As he rested, he saw a little fish swimming by. The whale felt an urge to play with the fish, but he was too tired. So, he closed his eyes and rested some more. 
After a while, the whale woke up feeling refreshed. He saw the little fish again and they started to play together. They swam and jumped in the water, having lots of fun. The whale was happy he took a rest and felt better.
