Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She loved to design things. One day, she wanted to make a chair. Lucy was very excited.
Lucy was very careful while making the chair. She put big wood and a soft cushion on top. When she was done, she wanted to show her mom and dad.
But when Lucy tried to sit on the chair, something unexpected happened. The chair moved! It was not a chair, it was a big turtle! The turtle said, "Hello, Lucy!" Lucy was surprised but happy. She made a new friend and they played together.
