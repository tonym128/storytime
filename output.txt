Once upon a time, there was a little ant. The ant was very scared of all the big things around him. One day, the ant met a friendly butterfly. The butterfly asked the ant why he was so scared. The ant told the butterfly that he was afraid of everything.
The butterfly told the ant not to be afraid and that he should try to part ways with things that scared him. The ant listened to the butterfly and decided to be brave. He started to walk around and explore the world.
As the ant continued to explore, he noticed that the world wasn't so scary anymore. In fact, he found that he enjoyed looking at all the different flowers and insects that lived there. The moral of the story is that sometimes it's good to part ways from scary things and try new things.
