Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the snow. One day, she saw a big structure made of snow. It was so tall that it touched the sky. 
Lily's mom came outside and said, "Lily, it's time to come inside. You look miserable. You need to warm up." 
Lily replied, "But Mommy, I want to catch snowflakes on my tongue. They taste so good!" 
Her mom smiled and said, "Okay, but first let's go inside and have some hot chocolate." 
Lily was so happy to have hot chocolate and she forgot all about the snow. She snuggled up with her mom and ate the chocolate while they watched the snow fall outside.
