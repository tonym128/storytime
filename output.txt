Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing outside and picking flowers. One day, she found a bottle of lotion in the grass. It smelled really good, so she put some on her hands.
But then, dark clouds came and it started to rain. Lily didn't want to go inside because she was having so much fun playing. The rain made the lotion on her hands all runny and sticky. 
Suddenly, Lily had an idea. She ran to her mom's room and put the lotion on her face. But it didn't work anymore! The lotion was too wet and bitter. Lily learned that lotion doesn't change clothes, but you wear it anyway.
