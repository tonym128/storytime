Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big bag of marbles that she loved to play with. One day, she went to the park to play with her marbles. She sat down on a bench and started playing.
Suddenly, a little boy came up to her and said, "Hi! Can I play with you?" Lily smiled and said, "Sure! You can have this one." She gave the boy a marble.
The boy looked very proud and said, "Thank you! I'm proud of my marble." Lily nodded and they played together for a long time. They had so much fun that Lily forgot all about her bag of marbles. When it was time to go home, Lily said goodbye to the boy and walked away, still feeling proud of her new friend and his marble.
