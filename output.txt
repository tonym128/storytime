Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore the woods behind her house. One day, she found a shiny red pill on the ground. It looked mysterious, but she didn't know what it was. 
Lily picked up the pill and showed it to her mom. Her mom told her not to touch it because it could make her sick. Lily promised not to touch it again. 
Later that day, Lily's friend Jack came over to play. They decided to go on an adventure in the woods. Lily remembered the mysterious pill she found, but she didn't want to show it to Jack. Jack asked her why she wasn't there and Lily lied and said she didn't know. 
As they were walking, Jack accidentally stepped on something and fell into a hole. He was hurt and needed help. Lily realized that she should have told him about the mysterious pill. She felt bad and decided to tell him the truth. Jack was okay, but they both learned to trust each other's recommendations and not take things that could be dangerous.
