One day, a boy named Tim went to the park. He saw a big slide and wanted to play on it. The sun was bright and the sky was blue. Tim was very happy.
As Tim played, he met a girl named Lily. Lily said, "Hi, I like to slide too!" They decided to slide together. They both went up and down the slide, laughing and having fun.
Then, something unexpected happened. A big ball fell from the sky! Tim and Lily were surprised. They looked up and saw a friendly bird holding the ball. The bird said, "I'm sorry, I dropped my ball by accident. Let's all play together!" Tim, Lily, and the bird played all day and became good friends.
