Once upon a time, in a small house, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play with his toys and make noise. One day, he was playing with his loud toy drum. He was so happy and having fun. But, he was also being foolish.
Tim's mom asked him to be quiet because his baby sister was sleeping. But Tim did not listen. He kept playing his drum and making noise. His baby sister woke up and started to cry. Tim's mom was not happy.
Tim's mom told him that he needed to be more quiet. She said, "If you don't stop making noise, I will have to punish you." Tim did not want to be punished, so he decided to play with his toys in a quiet place. He learned that being foolish was not good, and he didn't want to make his baby sister cry again.
