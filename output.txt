Once upon a time, there was a girl named Sue. Sue had a long brush. She loved to count with her brush. One day, she went outside to play.
Sue saw a big tree. She wanted to count its leaves. She started counting, "One, two, three..." But then, a cat jumped out of the tree! Sue was very surprised.
The cat said, "Thank you for counting my leaves. I am a magic cat!" Sue was happy to help. The magic cat gave Sue a wish. Sue wished for more toys to play with. They played together all day and became best friends.
