Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy's family went on a trip to visit his grandparents who lived far away. They drove for a long time until they finally arrived at their house. Timmy was so happy to see his grandparents!
His grandpa was a doctor who worked at the hospital. He was very nice and always wore a white coat. Timmy and his grandpa would play games and tell stories together. One day, they decided to make some cookies. Timmy helped his grandpa mix the ingredients and put them in the oven. The cookies smelled so good!
After they finished making the cookies, Timmy's family sat down to eat them. The cookies were so delicious! Timmy's grandpa said, "These cookies are ancient kind. They have been in the oven for a very long time." Timmy didn't know what ancient meant, but he knew that the cookies tasted really good. He smiled and felt very happy to be with his family and his grandpa.
