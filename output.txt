Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat grapes, but one day she ate too many and her tummy hurt. Lily said, "Ouch, my tummy hurts!" Her mommy gave her some medicine and told her to rest. 
While she was resting, Lily heard a loud noise outside. She looked out the window and saw a big bird. The bird was trying to take her grapes! Lily didn't want the bird to take her grapes, so she said, "Stop, bird! Those are my grapes!" 
The bird didn't listen and kept trying to take the grapes. Lily got upset and said, "Mommy, help! The bird is taking my grapes!" Her mommy went outside and scared the bird away. Lily was happy that her grapes were safe and she could eat them without any more trouble.
