 Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue had a big dog named Max. They liked to play in the open yard. One day, they saw a big cobweb in the yard. Sue and Max were scared.
Sue said to Max, "Max, let's hurry and move away from the cobweb." Max nodded and they ran away from the cobweb. They found a new hiding spot and felt safe.
Later, Sue and Max went back to the cobweb. They saw a tiny spider named Sam. Sam said, "Thank you for not touching my cobweb." Sue and Max were happy they did not touch the cobweb. They made a new friend that day.
