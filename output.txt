Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her friends. One day, Lily's friend fell down and hurt her hand. Lily wanted to prevent her friend from getting hurt again, so she gave her a band-aid.
Lily's friend was happy and they continued playing together. Later, they played a game where they had to count to zero. Lily thought it was funny when she said "zero" instead of "zero". Her friend laughed too.
At the end of the day, Lily was happy because she prevented her friend from getting hurt and everyone had fun playing together. She went to bed feeling proud of herself for being a good friend.
