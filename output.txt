Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to help her mom in the garden. One day, Lily's mom asked her to try pulling out the same herb that they were planting. Lily tried her best, but the herb was too strong for her little hands.
Suddenly, a big, smelly skunk came by and started to spray them with its smelly spray. Lily's mom quickly grabbed her and ran inside the house. They were both covered in the smelly skunk spray and had to take a bath to get clean.
After their bath, Lily's mom told her a story about a girl who tried to pull out a whole herb with a strong breath, but it didn't work and only blew out the skunk's smelly spray. The girl realized that sometimes it's better to wait for help instead of trying to do everything by yourself.
Lily learned her lesson and never tried to pull out the wrong herb again. She also learned to be careful around smelly animals.
