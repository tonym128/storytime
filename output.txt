Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to play in the water. One day, he saw a big raft appear in the river. He thought it was a fun thing to play on.
Timmy climbed onto the raft and started to float down the river. But suddenly, the raft started to rock. Timmy got scared and called for help. A man appeared and said, "Don't worry, I'll help you."
The man helped Timmy to get off the raft and they walked along the riverbank. Timmy thanked the man and said, "That was a terrible situation, but you saved me." The man smiled and said, "I'm just glad you're safe."
