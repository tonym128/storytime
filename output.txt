Once upon a time, there was a big farm. On the farm, there was a little horse named Sam. Sam was not like the other horses. He was sad because he was uncomfortable. His jumping made it hard for him to run and play.
One day, Sam's friend, a little bird named Tim, came to visit. Tim saw Sam feeling sad and asked, "Why are you so sad, Sam?" Sam told Tim about his uncomfortable jumping. Tim wanted to help Sam, so he had an idea.
Tim told Sam to close his eyes and imagine a big, soft nest. Sam closed his eyes and imagined himself in a cozy nest. When he opened his eyes, he felt his jumping go away. Now, Sam could run and play without any trouble. Sam was so happy, and he and Tim played all day long.
