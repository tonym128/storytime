Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to play with dolls and toys. One day, she went to the store with her mom. She saw a beautiful model car in the window. She asked her mom if she could have it. Her mom said, "Maybe for your birthday."
Lily was sad but didn't give up. She asked her mom every day if she could have the car. Finally, on her birthday, her mom gave her the car. Lily was so happy! She played with it all day long.
But then, something unexpected happened. The car broke! Lily was so sad. Her mom said, "Don't worry, we can fix it." They went to a charming mechanic who fixed the car. Lily was so happy to have her model car back. She said, "Thank you, Mommy and thank you, mechanic!"
