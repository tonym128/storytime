Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play and have fun, but one day he got sick. His mom took some medicine to help him feel better. Timmy didn't like the medicine because it tasted yucky.
But then, Timmy's mom told him a story about her ordinary life. In the story, she used to play with her children and have fun at the same time. Timmy realized that he could replace his sickness with happiness by playing with his friends.
So, Timmy took his medicine and went outside to play. He had so much fun with his friends that he forgot all about feeling sick. From then on, Timmy learned that sometimes it's important to replace things that seem yucky with something ordinary, because it can bring more joy and happiness.
