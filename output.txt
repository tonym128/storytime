One day, a friendly dog named Max was walking in the park. He saw a big house and wanted to enter. Max walked up to the door and said, "I want to go in."
Inside the house, Max found many other dogs. They were all playing and having fun. Max wanted to play too. He went up to a friendly cat named Luna and said, "Can I play with you?" Luna said, "Yes, let's play together!"
They played and played, but then something unexpected happened. Max and Luna found a magic box. They opened the box and saw a big, yummy cake inside. Max and Luna shared the cake with all their new friends in the house. They all had a great day and were very happy.
