Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to eat yummy food. One day, his mom made him a big plate of yummy food. It had pink fruits, green veggies, and orange juice. Tim was so happy to see all the yummy food on his plate.
But then, Tim's little sister, Sue, came into the room. Sue was very hungry too. She tried to take Tim's plate away from him. Tim did not want to lose his yummy food, so he held onto the plate very tight.
Sue pulled harder and harder, but Tim was strong. Finally, Sue let go of the plate and it fell to the floor. The plate broke into many pieces. Tim was sad that his yummy food was gone. But his mom came into the room with a new plate of yummy food for him. Tim was happy again, and he shared his new plate with Sue. They both enjoyed the yummy food together.
