Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a toy car with a high wheel. He loved to play with his car all day.
One day, Tim saw a girl named Sue. Sue was sad because she had no toys to play with. Tim wanted to help Sue, so he said, "Sue, do you want to play with my car?" Sue smiled and said, "Yes, please!"
Tim and Sue played with the car together. They had so much fun! But then, Tim's mom said, "Tim, you must pay for the ice cream we just bought." Tim gave Sue some money, and Sue gave Tim a big hug. They both enjoyed their ice cream and became best friends.
