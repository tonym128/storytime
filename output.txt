Once upon a time, there was a sleepy cat named Kitty. Kitty loved to take naps under the big tree in the park. Every day, she would go to the tree, curl up in her soft bed, and sleep.
One sunny day, Kitty found a quiz on the ground. She was curious and wanted to play. Kitty asked her friend, Doggy, to play with her. They took turns asking each other questions. They laughed and had fun.
After they finished the quiz, Kitty and Doggy felt happy and not sleepy anymore. They learned that playing together is more fun than playing alone. The moral of the story is that sharing and playing with friends can make you feel refreshed and happy.
