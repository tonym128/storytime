 One day, a little girl named Mia wanted to visit the pond. She asked her mom, "Can I go to the pond, please?" Her mom said, "Yes, but be careful and stay safe."
Mia went to the pond and saw a little duck. The duck was lost and was helpless. Mia wanted to help the duck. She said, "Don't be scared, I will help you."
Mia picked up the duck and walked around the pond. She found the duck's family on some other side of the pond. The duck was happy and said, "Thank you, Mia!" Mia felt good because she helped the duck and went to visit the pond.
