Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily went to the park with her mom. While playing, she saw a filthy dog. 
Lily: "Mommy, look at that dirty dog. He needs a bath."
Mom: "Yes, he does. Let's go see if we can find him a home."
They walked around the park and found a cute little dog in the distance. 
Lily: "Mommy, can we take him home with us?"
Mom: "I don't think we can. He has a license to be in our backyard."
The dog had an urge to come home with them, but they knew it was important to follow the rules. So they decided to adopt him and give him a good home. From that day on, Lily and the dog became the best of friends.
