One day, a boy named Tim went outside to play. It was very cold and icy. Tim saw a big tree and decided to climb it. He climbed up and up, all the way to the top. From there, he could see the whole park.
As Tim sat on a branch, he saw a little bird shivering in the cold. He felt sad for the bird and made a promise. "I promise to help you, little bird," Tim said. He picked up the bird and put it in his warm pocket.
But then, something unexpected happened! The bird started to laugh and said, "Thank you, Tim! I'm not really a bird. I'm a fairy in disguise!" The fairy waved her wand, and the icy tree became warm and cozy. Tim and the fairy played on the tree all day, laughing and having fun.
