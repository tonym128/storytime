 Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He liked to play with his ball outside. One day, while playing, he saw a loop on the ground. It was hard and looked like a big loop. Tim thought it was fun to play with.
Tim picked up the loop and started to roll it on the ground. It was a hard loop, but he liked it a lot. He rolled it up and down the green grass. He rolled it over the fence, and it was fun to see how far it went.
After a while, Tim's mom called him to come inside. Tim picked up his ball and walked back home. He showed his mom the hard loop he found. She smiled and said, "What a fun toy to play with!" Tim was happy and couldn't wait to play with his loop again the next day.
