Once upon a time, there was a little birdie. He lived in a big tree with lots of twigs. One day, he saw a cute little worm on a twig. The birdie thought the worm looked very tasty, so he tried to eat it. 
But the worm was too tough for the birdie to eat. He tried and tried, but he couldn't get snack on it. The birdie got very hungry and sad. 
Then, a big storm came and the wind blew the twig with the worm away. The birdie was very sad and hungry. He looked for the worm, but he couldn't find it. In the end, the birdie went to sleep without any food and had a bad dream.
