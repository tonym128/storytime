Once upon a time, there was a big yellow truck named Max. Max loved to drive on the wide road and show off his shiny paint. One day, Max was driving so fast that he didn't pay attention to the mechanic's red light. The car suddenly broke down and Max got very sad.
After a while, a kind man came and helped Max. The man was the driver of a tow truck, and he knew how to fix any car. The tow truck driver said Max needed a new light and Max was excited. The tow truck driver changed Max's light, and Max was happy again.
But then, something unexpected happened. The tow truck driver had to go to a store to supply some tools for Max. Max was sad again because he thought he wouldn't be able to drive without the new light. But then, the store owner surprised Max by giving him a special new light that would keep him driving safely. Max was so happy and grateful for the tow truck driver's help. From that day on, Max always made sure to pay attention to the rules of the road.
