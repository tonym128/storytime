Once upon a time, there was a mouse named Bob. Bob loved cheese more than anything. He would always look for cheese to eat. One day, Bob found a big piece of cheese in a house. He was very happy.
Bob wanted to take the cheese to his home. But the cheese was big and heavy. So, Bob had an idea. He would tear the cheese into smaller pieces. That way, he could carry the cheese home without leaving any pieces behind.
Bob was not shy, so he started to tear the cheese. He tore it into many small pieces. He put the small pieces in his mouth and bit them. They tasted so good! Bob was very proud of himself. He knew he was a good mouse. And now, Bob could enjoy the cheese all by himself.
