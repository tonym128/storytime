Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. She loved to paint. She would paint all day with her big brush and bright colors. One day, she painted a big, round sun and some pretty flowers.
Amy's friend, Tom, came over to play. He saw the paintings and said, "Wow! I like your paintings, Amy!" Amy smiled and said, "Thank you, Tom! Do you want to paint with me?" Tom nodded, and they painted together.
As they painted, a spicy smell filled the air. They looked around and saw Amy's mom cooking dinner. She was making spicy soup for them. Amy and Tom ran to the kitchen and said, "We love spicy soup!" They ate the soup and painted more pictures together. They had a lot of fun that day.
