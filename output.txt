Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and eat cookies. One day, Lily's mom gave her a package to open. Inside was a new toy for Lily to play with. She was so happy and hugged her mom. 
As Lily played with her new toy, she noticed that it was very flexible. She could bend it and twist it in any way she wanted. She even tried to make it talk, but it couldn't. 
Later that day, Lily's mom asked her to sign her name on a card. Lily didn't know how to write her name, so her mom helped her. She used a pen to make the letters S on the card. Lily was proud of herself for signing her name.
