Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a large, warm scarf that her mommy gave her. Lily loved her scarf very much. One day, she went for a walk in the park with her scarf on.
In the park, she saw a boy named Tom. Tom was sad because he didn't have a scarf like Lily. He said, "Why do you have a large scarf? I don't like it." Lily felt sad for Tom and wanted to help him. She said, "I promise I can give you my scarf if you stop being sad."
Tom thought about it and said, "Okay, I promise I won't be sad anymore." Lily gave her scarf to Tom, and he wore it all day. Tom was very happy, and Lily felt good for helping her new friend. They played in the park together and had lots of fun. From that day on, Lily and Tom were best friends, and they always kept their promises to each other.
