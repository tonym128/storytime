Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a yellow dress that she loved to wear. One day, Lily went to the park to play. While she was there, she saw a big dog with a chain around its neck. Lily was scared, but the dog was very friendly. It wagged its tail and licked her face. Lily realized that the dog wasn't scary at all and she wasn't scared anymore. She played with the dog for a while and then went home, happy and not scared anymore.
