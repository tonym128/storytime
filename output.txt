Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to read books. He had a big bookcase in his room. The bookcase was full of colorful books.
One day, Tim saw a famous book on the top shelf of his bookcase. He wanted to read it, but he was too small to reach it. Tim asked his big sister, Sue, for help. "Sue, can you please help me get the famous book?" he said.
Sue was happy to help her brother. She got the book down from the top shelf and gave it to Tim. They read the famous book together and learned many new things. Tim was so happy that he could read the book with Sue's help. And from that day on, they became the best of friends.
