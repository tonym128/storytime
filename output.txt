Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to eat spicy food and always asked his mommy to make him spicy noodles. One day, Timmy received a present from his grandma. It was a big box wrapped in shiny paper.
Timmy was so excited to open the present, but his mommy told him he had to wait until after dinner. Timmy was sad but he ate all his dinner so he could open the present. When he finally opened the box, he found a spicy pepper shaker inside.
Timmy didn't like spicy things, but he decided to try the pepper and put it in his mouth. To his surprise, the pepper was very spicy and made his mouth hurt. Timmy tried to rinse it out, but it was too late. His mouth was on fire and he started crying. Sadly, Timmy learned that sometimes surprises can be scary and it's important to listen to his mommy.
