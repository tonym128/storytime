One day, a little girl named Amy went to play outside. She saw a big, impressive tree with pretty birds. Amy wanted to climb the tree, but she was too small. She felt sad.
Amy found a soft cloth near the tree. She had an idea! She would go to her grandpa and ask for help. Maybe he could get her a ladder so she could climb the tree.
Grandpa was very nice. He gave Amy a ladder and a big smile. She put the ladder near the tree and climbed up. Now, she could see the birds and feel happy. Amy thanked her grandpa and went home with a big smile.
