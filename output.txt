Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, she saw a shooting star in the sky and shouted, "Wow, look at the star! It's so pretty!"
Her friend Timmy said, "I want to catch the star and keep it forever." But Lily said, "No, we can't catch the star, it's too far away."
Suddenly, a friendly bird flew down and said, "I can help you catch the star, but we need to decorate my nest first." So, Lily and Timmy helped the bird decorate its nest with pretty flowers and shiny stars. The bird was so happy that it gave them a ride on its back to catch the star. They reached the star and brought it back to the bird's nest. The bird was so grateful that it gave them a ride back home. From that day on, Lily and Timmy always looked up at the stars and remembered their friendly bird friend.
