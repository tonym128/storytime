Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved ice cream, especially chocolate ice cream. One day, she went to the park with her mom and dad. They bought her a big ice cream cone with lots of cream on top.
Lily was so happy and started eating it right away. Suddenly, a little boy came over and asked if he could have a bite. Lily didn't want to share because she wanted to enjoy her ice cream all by herself. But her mom and dad told her that it's nice to share and it will make her happy.
So, Lily gave the little boy a piece of her ice cream. But then, the little boy accidentally dropped the ice cream cone on the ground. Lily was so sad and embarrassed that she didn't want to eat it anymore. But her mom and dad told her that accidents happen and it's okay. They bought her another ice cream cone and this time, Lily shared it with the little boy. They both had a great time eating ice cream together.
