Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park with her friends. One day, while playing hide and seek, Lily found a small and cute puppy. It was so kissable and cuddly that Lily knew she wanted to keep it forever.
Lily's friends wanted to play with the puppy too, but Lily was worried they might hurt it. She decided to hide the puppy in her pocket and play with her friends. After a while, Lily couldn't resist any longer and took the puppy out of her pocket. It ran around happily, and Lily's friends were amazed.
Suddenly, the puppy ran away and Lily couldn't find it. She searched everywhere, but the puppy was nowhere to be found. Lily felt sad and worried. Then, she remembered her pocket and looked inside. To her surprise, the puppy was still there, safe and sound, with a note that said, "Thank you for playing with me. Love, your friend." Lily smiled and hugged her cute little friend tightly.
