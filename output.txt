Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to walk on the street with her mommy. One day, while they were walking, Lily saw a big, round ball on the street. She wanted to play with it, but she was too nervous to go near it.
Her mommy noticed that Lily was feeling nervous and asked her what was wrong. Lily told her mommy about the ball and how she was too scared to go near it. Her mommy smiled and said, "Don't worry, I'll push you to the ball so you can play with it." Lily felt happy and grateful to her mommy for helping her. They walked to the ball together and Lily had so much fun playing with it. From that day on, Lily wasn't nervous anymore when she saw something on the street.
