Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to dance and twirl around in her pink dress. One day, she went to the store with her mommy to buy some ice cream. 
At the store, Lily saw her friend, Max. Max had a big bag of candy and Lily felt envious. She wanted some candy too. "Can I have some candy, Max?" she asked. Max shook his head and said, "No, Lily. You can't have any candy today." 
Lily felt sad, but she still danced around the store. As they left, Max's bag of candy fell and spilled all over the floor. "Oh no!" Max cried. "My candy!" Lily saw that Max was upset and decided to help him pick up the candy. They both laughed and danced around the store while they cleaned up the mess. In the end, Max even gave Lily some candy as a thank you.
