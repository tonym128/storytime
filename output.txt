Once upon a time, there were two twins named Tim and Tom. They were always together and loved to play. One day, they went to the park to play on the slide. Tim went first and slid down the slide very fast. Tom wanted to try too, but he was scared.
Tim said, "Don't be scared, Tom! It's fun!" But Tom was still scared. Tim then had an idea. He said, "Let's go down the slide one more time, but this time we'll go down together." So they did, and it was so much fun that Tom forgot to be scared.
After they finished playing, they went home and their mom asked how their day was. Tom said, "It was fun! We went down the slide and it was very fast. But then we went down the slide and our mom said we were scared. That's crazy!" Their mom smiled and said, "I'm glad you had fun, but next time make sure you're not so scared." The twins nodded and promised to be more careful.
