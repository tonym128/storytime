Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Ben. Ben loved to eat yummy carrots all day. One day, he found a calendar on the ground. It had pictures of yummy carrots on it. Ben was very happy and showed it to his friend, Tina the turtle.
Tina said, "I recommend you share the yummy carrots with others. Sharing is good." Ben thought about it and decided to share the calendar with all his friends.
Ben and his friends looked at the calendar together. They saw many yummy carrots pictures. They learned that sharing is caring. From that day on, Ben and his friends always shared their yummy food with each other. They were all happy and played together every day.
