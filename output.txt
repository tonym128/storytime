Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy's mom asked him to help with the laundry. Timmy thought it was a foolish idea because he wanted to play with his toys. But Timmy's mom said he had to help her.
Timmy helped his mom fold the laundry. He tried his best, but he got frustrated because it was hard work. Suddenly, Timmy saw a bug on the floor. He said to his mom, "Look, Mommy! A bug! Can I shoot it with my toy gun?"
His mom laughed and said, "No, Timmy. We don't shoot bugs. We just catch them and put them outside." Timmy nodded and went back to folding the laundry. He realized that helping his mom was important, even if it was a little foolish sometimes.
