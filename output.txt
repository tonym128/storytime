Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, Lily's mom suggested they have a picnic in the park. Lily was very excited and helped her mom pack sandwiches, fruit, and cookies.
When they arrived at the park, Lily's mom put down a big blanket and started to unpack the food. Lily helped by juice boxes and water bottles. As they ate, Lily's friend Sarah said, "This picnic is so lively!"
Lily's mom smiled and said, "I'm glad you enjoy it. Let's all have some more food to eat." After they finished eating, Lily and her friends played some games and ran around the park. It was a fun day for everyone!
