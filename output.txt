Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue was a very thoughtful girl. She always wanted to help her friends and family. Sue liked to play outside in the sun.
One day, Sue saw a motion in the grass. She went closer to see what it was. It was a tiny bug. The bug was trying to find its way home. Sue thought she could help the bug.
Sue picked up the bug and put it on a leaf. She looked around and saw the bug's home. Sue put the leaf near the bug's home. The bug was very happy. It went inside its home and Sue felt good. Sue had a fun day helping the bug.
