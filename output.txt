One sunny day, a bird named Billy wanted to soar high in the sky. He flapped his wings and went up, up, up! Billy was so happy to fly and see all the things below him.
As he flew, he saw an elderly dog named Daisy. Daisy was sitting on a soft, green lawn. She looked up and saw Billy flying high. "Hello, Billy!" she said. "You are so good at flying!"
Billy smiled at Daisy and said, "Thank you, Daisy! I love to soar in the sky. It makes me feel so free!" Daisy wagged her tail and watched Billy fly away. She knew that Billy was happy and healthy, and she was happy just to see him soar.
