Once upon a time, in a small house, there was a boy named Mark. Mark had a big box of toys. He loved to play with them every day. But there was one toy he did not like. It was a big, bitter lemon.
One day, Mark's mom said, "Mark, you have to clean your room. There is too much tip on the floor." Mark did not want to clean his room, but he knew his mom was right. So, he started to pick up his toys and put them away.
Mark picked up his toys one by one. He found the bitter lemon toy under the bed. He put it in a bag and gave it to his mom. When he was done, his room was clean and his mom was happy. Mark learned that even though some things might be bitter, he could make things better by helping out.
