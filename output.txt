Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and his dog. One day, Timmy's mom asked him to tidy up his room. Timmy didn't want to tidy up because he wanted to keep playing. His mom said, "Timmy, if you tidy up your room, we can go to the park later." Timmy thought about it and decided to tidy up.
After he finished tidying up, Timmy's mom called him for dinner. She made his favorite food: spaghetti! Timmy was so excited to eat. While they were eating, Timmy's dad told a joke. Timmy laughed so hard that he accidentally threw his fork across the room. His dad laughed too and said, "Don't throw your fork, Timmy!" Timmy was happy that his family was having fun and he finished his dinner.
