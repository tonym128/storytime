Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toy cart and push it around the house. One day, Lily's mom asked her to help deliver some cookies to their neighbor, Mrs. Smith.
Lily was excited to help and started pulling her cart through the streets. As she walked, she saw a big, scary dog in the distance. She felt scared and wanted to run away, but she knew that she had to deliver the cookies to Mrs. Smith.
Lily took a deep breath and kept walking, slowly but surely. When she finally arrived at Mrs. Smith's house, she saw that she had moved away. Lily felt sad and didn't know what to do. But then she remembered the cookies in her cart and offered some to Mrs. Smith. She smiled and thanked Lily for delivering them. From that day on, Lily wasn't as scared of dogs and always carried cookies with her in her cart.
