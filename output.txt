Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very sleepy and wanted to take a nap. She went to her room and lay down on her bed. She closed her eyes and fell asleep.
While she was sleeping, her mommy came in and mentioned that they were going to have ice cream for dessert. Lily woke up and got very excited. She loved ice cream!
Mommy took Lily to the kitchen and they got some ice cream. It was so yummy! After they finished, Lily went back to her room and fell asleep again. She dreamt about all the fun she had with mommy and the delicious ice cream.
