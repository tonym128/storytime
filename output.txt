Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to draw with his big box of crayons. One day, he drew a picture of a big, hungry bear. The bear was so hungry that it could not resist eating everything in its path.
Tim's mom saw the picture and said, "Oh my, that bear looks so hungry! Maybe we can make some food for the bear." Tim was excited to see what his mom would make. Together, they cooked a big pot of soup with yummy roast food.
Tim took the soup outside and called the bear. He said, "Bear, I made this yummy soup for you. You must be very hungry." The bear came closer and ate the soup. It was so happy that it stopped being hungry. Tim and the bear became good friends and played together every day.
