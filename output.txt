Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and run around in the park. One day, Lily's mom asked her to go upstairs to get her favorite book. But Lily was scared to go upstairs by herself because it was dark and mysterious.
Lily's mom said, "Don't worry, I'll go with you." So, Lily and her mom took each other's hands and started going upstairs. As they were walking, Lily noticed that her mom was holding a spray bottle.
"What are you doing with that spray bottle, mommy?" Lily asked.
"I'm spraying the plants to keep them healthy so they can grow big and strong," her mom replied.
Lily thought about it for a moment and said, "I want to help too!"
So, they both sprayed the plants together and went back downstairs. Lily felt proud that she could help her mom and learned that even if something seems mysterious or scary, it's always good to face it with someone you trust.
