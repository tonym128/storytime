Once upon a time, there was a kind girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and pick flowers. One day, Lily saw a bird flying high in the sky. The bird was happy and free.
Lily said, "I wish I could fly like that bird." Her mom replied, "You can't fly, but you can make a birdhouse. That would be helpful."
So, Lily went to her dad and asked him for some wood and nails. Her dad gave her all the things she needed. Lily's dad showed her how to make a birdhouse. It was hard work, but Lily did a great job.
When the birdhouse was finished, Lily put it outside. The bird flew down and went inside. Lily was so happy that she could help the bird. She said, "I give the bird a home!" Her parents smiled and said, "You are a kind and helpful girl."
