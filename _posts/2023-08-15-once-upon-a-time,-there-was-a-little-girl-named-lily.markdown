Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park with her friends. One day, they went to play on the swings. Lily's friend, Sarah, was pushing her on the swing. Lily thought the swing was amazing and swung higher and higher.
Suddenly, Lily saw a shiny red berry on the ground. She picked it up and showed it to Sarah. "Look, Sarah! I found a berry!" Lily exclaimed. Sarah looked at the berry and said, "That berry looks yummy. Can I have a bite?" 
Lily thought for a moment and then said, "Okay, but be careful. Don't chew on the berry too hard." Sarah took a small bite and said, "Mmm, this berry is delicious! Thank you, Lily!" They both smiled and continued to swing and play in the park.
