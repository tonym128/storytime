One day, a little boy named Tim went for a walk with his mom. They saw a big car on the side of the road. The car was red and shiny. Tim liked the car very much. He wanted to see it up close.
"Mom, can we go see the car?" Tim asked. His mom said yes, and they walked to the car. Tim looked inside and saw that the door was locked. A key was on the ground near the door. Tim picked it up and showed it to his mom.
"Good job, Tim! We will try to open the door," his mom said. They put the key in the door and turned it. The door opened, and they went inside the car. The car was fake. It was a toy car with wheels. Tim was happy to have the real car. They went home and played with the car all day.
