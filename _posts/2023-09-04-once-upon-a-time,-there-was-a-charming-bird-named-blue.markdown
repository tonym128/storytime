Once upon a time, there was a charming bird named Blue. Blue loved to soar high in the sky. One day, Blue saw a hotel far away. Blue was very happy and wanted to go there.
Blue flew to the hotel and saw many people. They were all having fun. Blue saw a little girl named Sue. Sue was sad because she lost her toy. Blue wanted to help Sue.
Blue soared high in the sky and looked for the toy. He found it near a tree. Blue took the toy back to Sue. Sue was very happy and thanked Blue. Blue and Sue became best friends.
The moral of the story is: Help others when they need it.
