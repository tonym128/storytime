Once upon a time, there was a boy who loved to play with his toys. One day, he wanted to play with his favorite toy, but it was in the attic. He climbed up the ladder to get it, but he accidentally knocked over a box. The box shook and a scary monster came out!
The boy was scared and ran away, but the monster chased him. The boy thought he was going to be caught, but then he saw a grumpy old man walking by. The man asked the boy what was wrong, and the boy told him about the monster. The old man laughed and said, "That's just the spirit of the toy! It's supposed to shake and move by itself."
The boy didn't believe him at first, but then he turned around and saw that the monster was gone. He was so happy and thanked the old man. From that day on, the boy learned to be careful when playing with his toys in the attic, but he also learned that sometimes things that seem scary can turn out to be fun at the full price.
