Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to ride in his motorcycle. One day, Timmy's mommy told him they were going on a trip. Timmy was so excited! But he had to pack his bags first. Timmy packed his toys and clothes, and even his motorcycle to take with him. 
When they arrived at their destination, Timmy's mommy told him to unpack his bags. Timmy didn't like unpacking because it was boring. But he did it anyway. As he unpacked, he found a toy that was very attractive. It was a big red truck that he had never seen before. Timmy was so happy to have found it! 
After they finished unpacking, Timmy got back in his motorcycle and they went for a ride. Timmy was so excited to show off his new truck to everyone. He was happy he remembered to pack it.
