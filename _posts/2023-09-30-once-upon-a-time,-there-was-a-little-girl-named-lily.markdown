Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go on walks with her mommy in the forest. One day, they went on a walk and saw a deer. The deer was very smelly because he had been playing in the mud.
Lily said, "Mommy, look at the deer! He's so smelly!"
Her mommy replied, "Yes, he is. But he's still beautiful to look at."
Suddenly, they heard a loud noise. It was a bear! The bear was very big and scary. Lily and her mommy were very scared.
But then, something unexpected happened. The sock that the deer was wearing flew off and the bear saw it. The bear started to chase the sock, and Lily and her mommy ran away as fast as they could.
After they were safe, Lily said, "That was a scary adventure! But the deer was still beautiful, even if he had a smelly sock on his foot."
