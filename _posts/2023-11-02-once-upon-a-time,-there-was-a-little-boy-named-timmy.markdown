Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to go on adventures with his dog, Spot. One day, Timmy and Spot went to the park to play. They ran and played until they found a big tree to sit under. 
As Timmy sat down, he noticed the sun was setting in the west. The sky turned purple and pink. Timmy thought it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. Spot barked happily and wagged his tail. 
Timmy and Spot stayed under the tree for a long time, watching the purple sky until it was dark. Then they went back home, happy and tired from their fun day. From that day on, Timmy loved going on adventures and finding new things to see.
