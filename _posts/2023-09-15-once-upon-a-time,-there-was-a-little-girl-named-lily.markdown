Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat mint candies, especially the green ones. One day, she went to the store with her mom to buy some more. While they were there, they saw a man who was acting foolish. He was wearing a funny hat and dancing around. 
Lily's mom told her to stay away from the man and they continued to buy their mint candies. But Lily couldn't resist the snolalph and wanted to say hi to the man. She walked over to him and gave him a mint candy. The man smiled and thanked her. 
Lily was happy that she could make the man smile. She went home with her mom and shared her mint candies with her little brother. From that day on, Lily always remembered the man at the store who started acting foolish and made her smile.
