One day, a boy named Tim went out to play. He saw a big puddle of wet water. He thought it was fun to jump in it. As he jumped, he became wet too. The water went everywhere!
Tim saw an ugly bug near the puddle. The bug had many legs and big eyes. Tim said, "Hi, Mr. Bug! Do you want to play in the wet puddle with me?" The ugly bug looked at Tim and said, "Yes, I would like to play. I can turn into a pretty bug if I jump in the wet puddle."
Tim and the ugly bug both jumped in the wet puddle. They turned into a pretty bug and played together. They had a lot of fun in the puddle. Soon, it was time for Tim to go home. He said goodbye to the ugly bug and went back to his house. Tim had a big smile on his face because he made a new friend.
