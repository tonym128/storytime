Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the garden with her toys. One day, she found a beautiful poppy flower. She picked it up and showed it to her mom.
"Mommy, look! I found a pretty flower!" said Lily.
Her mom smiled and said, "That's lovely, Lily. But be careful, poppies can be dangerous if they have thorns."
Lily looked at the poppy and said, "I won't touch it anymore. I don't want to get hurt."
Suddenly, the wind started to blow and it got very cold. Lily said, "Mommy, I'm cold. Can we go inside?"
"Sure, let's go inside and have some hot chocolate," said her mom.
As they walked inside, Lily accidentally tore her favorite dress. She started to cry, but her mom hugged her and said, "It's okay, Lily. We can fix it. I'm just glad you're safe inside."
