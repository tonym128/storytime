One day, a cheerful girl named Lily went to the park. She saw her friend, Tim, who was trying to tie his shoes. Tim looked sad because he could not do it. Lily wanted to help Tim, so she went to him.
Lily said, "I can help you tie your shoes, Tim." Tim was happy to have Lily's help. They tried and tried, but Tim still could not tie his shoes. Then, an older boy named Ben saw them and laughed. Ben did not think they could do it.
Tim felt sad and Lily said, "Don't listen to Ben. We can do it if we try together." They tried one more time, and this time, they did it! Tim was very happy, and Lily was proud of their success.
The moral of the story is to never give up and always help your friends. Sometimes, all you need to do is try a little harder, and you will succeed.
