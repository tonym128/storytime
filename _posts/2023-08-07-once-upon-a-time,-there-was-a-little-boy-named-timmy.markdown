Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with dough and make funny shapes. One day, Timmy's mommy asked him to help her make a pizza. Timmy was so excited and asked, "What do we need?".
Mommy said, "We need dough, flour, sauce, and cheese. Can you measure out the ingredients for me?"
Timmy was happy to help and got the measuring cup. He measured the flour and sugar and carefully poured it into the dough. Then, they rolled out the dough and mommy helped Timmy make the pizza dough by rolling it out and cutting out the dough shapes.
As they were making the pizza dough, Timmy said, "Mommy, I'm ready to put the cheese on the pizza". Mommy smiled and said, "Great job, Timmy! Now let's put it in the oven and wait for it to bake". They put the pizza in the oven and waited patiently for it to cook. Finally, the pizza was ready and they sat down to eat
