Once upon a time, there was a chubby bunny named Benny. Benny loved to play with his favorite toy, a missile. He would spend hours throwing it around and imagining it was flying through the sky. 
One day, Benny's mom told him it was time for his nap. Benny didn't want to stop playing with his missile, but he knew he must listen to his mom. He put his missile down and closed his eyes. 
Suddenly, Benny's missile started to blink and shake! Benny opened his eyes and saw that his missile had come to life and was flying around his room! Benny was so surprised and excited that he couldn't stop giggling. 
From that day on, Benny and his missile became the best of friends. They would play together every day and Benny was always so happy when he was with his trusty friend.
