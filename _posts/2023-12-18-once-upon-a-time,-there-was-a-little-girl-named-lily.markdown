Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to enjoy walks with her mom and dad. One day, they went for a walk in the park. The sun was shining and the birds were singing. Lily was very happy.
While walking, Lily saw a big red ball. She wanted to play with it, but she was fearful. She didn't know what the ball could do. Lily's mom saw her looking at the ball and said, "Don't be scared, Lily. It's just a ball to play with."
Lily's dad picked up the ball and gave it to her. She started to play with the ball and soon she was laughing and having fun. She enjoyed her walk in the park with her mom, dad, and the big red ball.
