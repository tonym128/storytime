Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot had a different collar than his friends. It was red and blue. Spot liked to play near the pond. One day, Spot saw a big frog near the pond.
"Hi frog, I like your big hat!" said Spot. The frog looked at Spot and said, "Thank you, Spot. Do you want to play with me?" Spot was happy and jumped into the water. They played together, splashing and having fun.
After playing, Spot and the frog were tired. They sat near the pond to rest. The sun was warm, and they felt good. Spot looked at his different collar and smiled. He was happy to have a new friend.
