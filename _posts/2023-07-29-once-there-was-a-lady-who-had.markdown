Once there was a lady who had an important meal to feed. She was busy in the kitchen when suddenly, the phone rang. She stopped what she was doing and quickly answered the phone. It was her friend and she said it was time to feed the meal. 
The lady went to grab all the ingredients she would need and put them on the counter. She was counting down the spices and spices. 
When she was done, she looked up at the phone. It had yielded to her and she realized it was broken. 
She ran to the store to get a new handkerchief. But when she arrived she found out the old one was too tight! She couldn't find the right part. 
The lady shrugged her shoulders, feeling sad and frustrated. She needed to find a way to feed her meal. But it was too early to do so. 
So she went home and set the milk stood straight. She tried wiping the bowl but nothing looked right. 
Then she had an idea. She decided to try stepping on the top, to see if it had the right support. So she did, and sure enough it worked! She was so happy she could finally feed her meal. 
The end.
