Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the park to play with her friend, Timmy. They played on the swings and the slide, and Lily said, "Look, Timmy! We can draw silly faces on the ground!" 
Timmy thought that was a great idea, so they started drawing silly faces with sticks and stones. Suddenly, they heard a loud noise. It was a group of birds flying overhead. 
Lily said, "Wow, that bird sounds so pretty!" Timmy agreed and said, "Let's feed them some bread crumbs." 
So, they ran to get some bread crumbs and threw them on the ground. The birds came down and ate the crumbs happily. Lily and Timmy were so happy to see the birds enjoying their snack. They continued to play and have fun at the park until it was time to go home.
