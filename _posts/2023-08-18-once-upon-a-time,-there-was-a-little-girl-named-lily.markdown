Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, Lily's mom asked her to deliver a package to their neighbor. Lily was happy to help her mom and took the package with her.
As Lily walked to the neighbor's house, she noticed a pretty frame lying on the ground. It was shiny and had sparkles on it. She picked it up and decided to keep it for herself.
When she arrived at the neighbor's house, Lily knocked on the door. But when the neighbor answered, Lily was embarrassed to show her the frame. She had accidentally broken it while carrying the package.
To her surprise, the neighbor didn't get mad. Instead, she told Lily that it was okay and that she was happy to see something so beautiful. Lily felt relieved and happy that the neighbor was kind. From then on, Lily learned to be honest and not take things that didn't belong to her.
