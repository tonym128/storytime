Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a toy cat named Mr. Whiskers. Mr. Whiskers was a bit filthy because he played in the mud all day. Lily loved Mr. Whiskers very much, so she took him everywhere she went.
One day, Lily and Mr. Whiskers went to the park. They played with the ball and had a lot of fun. But then, Lily fell down and hurt her knee. She cried because it hurt so much. Mr. Whiskers wanted to help Lily, so he started to rub her knee with his soft fur.
After some time, Lily's knee stopped hurting, and she felt better. She smiled and said "Thank you, Mr. Whiskers!" They hugged each other and continued to play. Lily and Mr. Whiskers had a great day at the park, and they went home to rest after their fun day.
