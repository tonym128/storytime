Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He loved to play outside in the sun. One day, he found a long strip of paper on the ground. It had a big, red heart on it. Tim wanted to help, so he decided to fold the paper.
Tim was very careful when he folded the paper. He did not want to rip it or make it dirty. He folded the paper one time, then twice, and then one more time at a time. The paper became flat and neat. Tim felt happy that he could make something nice with the paper.
Tim showed the folded strip to his mom. She was very proud of him for being careful and kind. She hung the strip on the wall for everyone to see. Tim learned that being careful and kind made him feel good. And from that day on, he always tried to help others and be careful with the things he found.
