Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She liked to play with her toys and run around outside. One day, her mommy asked her if she wanted to help make dinner. Lily didn't know what to do, so her mommy taught her how to chop vegetables with a big knife.
Lily thought it was funny that the knife was so sharp and shiny. She liked helping her mommy cook dinner and they made yummy spaghetti together. After dinner, Lily went to bed and fell asleep right away because she was so tired from all the fun she had that day.
The end.
