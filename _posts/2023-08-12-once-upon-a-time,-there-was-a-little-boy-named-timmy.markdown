Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a toy train with a black engine. He loved playing with it every day. One day, Timmy went outside to play with his train, but he couldn't find it. He looked everywhere, but it was nowhere to be found.
Timmy asked his mom, "Mommy, where is my train? I can't find it." His mom replied, "Did you check your toy box?" Timmy looked in his toy box and found his train. He was so happy and said, "Mommy, I found my train! It's black and has a black engine."
His mom said, "That's great, Timmy. I'm glad you found it. Now you can play with it all day long." Timmy was so happy and played with his train until it was time for dinner. From that day on, Timmy made sure to put his train back in its box so he wouldn't lose it again.
