Once upon a time, there was a big truck. The truck was very heavy and it had to carry a lot of things. One day, the truck was driving down the road when it saw a big cliff. The truck was scared and didn't know what to do. 
But then, the truck remembered something its driver had told it before. "Relax, everything will be okay," the driver had said. So the truck took a deep breath and tried to relax. It closed its eyes and took a deep breath in and out. 
Suddenly, the truck felt better. It realized that even though it was heavy and scared, it could still be brave and strong. And with that swore to face any chase that came its way. So the truck drove onto the road and continued on its way, feeling proud and happy.
