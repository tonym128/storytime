Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the grass and pick flowers. One day, he saw a little fairy sitting on a flower.
"Hello, fairy!" said Timmy.
"Hello, little boy," said the fairy. "I'm here to help you."
"How can you help me?" asked Timmy.
"I can make you wealthy," said the fairy. "But you must promise to share your flowers with others."
Timmy agreed and the fairy sprinkled some dust on his flowers. Suddenly, Timmy's flowers grew bigger and bigger until he had as many as a car!
But then, something unexpected happened. A big gust of wind blew all of Timmy's flowers away. Timmy was sad, but the fairy said, "Don't worry, little boy. I'll bring you more flowers tomorrow." And with a wave of her wand, Timmy's flowers grew even bigger and more beautiful than before. Timmy was very happy and thanked the fairy for her help.
