Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she found a pretty flower and picked it. She put it in her pocket so she could show her mom later.
As she was walking, she saw a man with an ugly hat. She didn't like it, but then she saw a spider on it. She wanted to touch it, but it pinched her finger. She cried and ran back home to show her mom the flower and look at the spider.
Her mom told her that spiders can pinch and sometimes it hurts a little, but it will go away soon. Lily felt better and put the flower in a vase. She was happy to have something pretty and interesting to show her mom.
