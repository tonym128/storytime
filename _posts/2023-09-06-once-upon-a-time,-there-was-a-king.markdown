Once upon a time, there was a king. The king was very brave. One day, he went for a walk in the forest.
In the forest, the king saw a big tree. He wanted to climb it. As he climbed, the tree started to rock. The king was scared, but he was brave.
Suddenly, a big bird came out of the tree. The bird said, "Don't be scared, I live in this tree." The king and the bird became friends. They played together and had lots of fun.
