Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim was a sleepy boy who loved to play with his toy cars. One day, Tim's mom said, "Tim, it's time for your nap." Tim didn't want to nap, but he knew he had to listen to his mom.
Before Tim went to bed, he asked his mom, "Can you record me playing with my cars in my room?" His mom smiled and said, "Of course, Tim!" She went to get her phone and recorded Tim playing with his cars.
That night, Tim had a dream. In his dream, he saw a big hospital with many rooms. In one room, he met a sleepy doctor. The doctor said, "Hello, Tim! Are you feeling okay in here?" Tim said, "Yes, I am just a little sleepy." The doctor smiled and said, "Don't worry, you'll feel better soon." Tim woke up feeling happy and ready to play with his cars again.
