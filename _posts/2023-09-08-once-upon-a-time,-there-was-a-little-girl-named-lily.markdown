Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved spending time with her daddy. One day, they went to the park to play. While they were there, they saw a harmless little bunny hopping around.
Lily wanted to play with the bunny, but her daddy said they couldn't because it might hurt the bunny. So, they just watched the bunny hop around for a little while.
After a few minutes, Lily's daddy asked her if she wanted to go home. Lily thought about it and decided that she wanted to spend some time with her daddy more than she wanted to play with the bunny. So, they walked back home together, happy to have spent time with each other. The end.
