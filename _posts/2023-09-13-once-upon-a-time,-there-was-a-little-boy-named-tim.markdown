Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to watch videos on his mom's phone. One day, while he was watching a video, his mom said, "Tim, please turn down the video. It is time for bed."
But Tim did not want to stop watching the video. He refused to turn off the phone. "No, Mom. I want to watch more video," he said. His mom looked at him and knew that he did not want to go to bed.
Tim's mom said, "Tim, it is not fair for you to watch too much video. You need to sleep and be a good boy." Tim thought about it and knew his mom was right. He turned off the phone and went to bed. From that day on, Tim made sure to turn off the screen and go to bed when it was time.
