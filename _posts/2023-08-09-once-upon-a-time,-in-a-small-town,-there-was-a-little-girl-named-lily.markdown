Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to pick berries in the forest. One sunny day, Lily put on her red shoes and went to the forest to find some berries.
As she walked, she saw her friend Tim. Tim had a long stick. He said, "Look, Lily! I have a stick. I can use it to shoot the berries down." Lily thought that was a fun idea. So, they took turns shooting the berries down from the tree.
Soon, they had a big basket full of colorful berries. Lily said, "This was a successful berry- shooting adventure!" They laughed and went home to eat their yummy berries. And they lived happily ever after.
