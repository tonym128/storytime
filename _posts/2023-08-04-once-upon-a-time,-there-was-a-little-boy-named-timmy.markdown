Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved trains, especially the big ones that went choo-choo. One day, Timmy went to the train station with his mommy and daddy. They saw a big train waiting for them. 
Timmy was so excited to see the train that he ran towards it. But his mommy said, "Stop, Timmy! It's not safe to run on the tracks." Timmy stopped and looked at the train. He thought it was so big and cool. 
Suddenly, the train conductor saw Timmy and his parents. He said, "Would you like to come on the train and see the inside?" Timmy's eyes got big and he nodded his head. He and his family got on the train and saw all the different parts. It was the best day ever!
