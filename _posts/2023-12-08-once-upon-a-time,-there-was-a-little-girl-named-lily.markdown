Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play and have fun, but sometimes she didn't behave very well. Her mom would always tell her to be good and listen to what she was told, but Lily would often forget.
One day, Lily's mom told her that if she didn't behave, she wouldn't be able to go to the park with her friends. Lily didn't want that to happen, so she tried her best to be good.
But then, her friends came over and it started to rain. They wanted to go outside and play, but their parents said they couldn't because they didn't want them to get wet. Lily remembered what her mom said about behaving and decided to join her friends in the rain instead.
They had so much fun jumping in puddles and getting wet. Lily was happy that she didn't miss out on the fun because she remembered to behave. From that day on, Lily tried her best to always listen to her mom and be good.
