Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to go on vacation with his family. One day, Tim's family went on a vacation to a place where the sun was always shining.
On this vacation, Tim saw a big, scary tree. He was scared and told his mom, "Mom, I don't believe there is a scary tree in the park." His mom smiled and said, "Don't worry, Tim. The tree is just big and scary because it has lots of leaves."
Later, Tim met a new friend named Lily. Lily was not scared of the big, scary tree. She said, "Tim, I was scared too, but now I believe there is nothing to be scared of." Tim and Lily played together under the tree and had a lot of fun.
At the end of the vacation, Tim learned that sometimes things that look scary are not so scary after all. He also learned that it's good to believe in yourself and your friends. And from that day on, Tim and Lily became best friends.
