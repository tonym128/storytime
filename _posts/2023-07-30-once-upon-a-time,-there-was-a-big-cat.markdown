Once upon a time, there was a big cat. The cat was very good at laying a big ball of yarn. The yarn was on the ground and the cat loved to play with it. 
One day, a little girl came along and saw the cat playing with the yarn. She thought it was very attractive with its bright colors. The cat came over to the little girl and let her play too. 
The two cats played together for a long time, rolling the yarn back and forth. When they were done, they lay down together and cuddled up with the yarn. They were very happy and became good friends.
