Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He had a toy car that he loved to play with every day. One day, Timmy's friend Billy came over to play. Billy wanted to play with Timmy's toy car, but Timmy didn't want to share.
"I don't want to share my car," Timmy said.
"But I want to play too," Billy replied.
Timmy thought about it and realized that he could solve the problem by sharing his car with Billy. He climbed up high on a swing and gave the car to Billy.
"Here you go," Timmy said.
Billy was happy and played with the car in the silence, making it his second turn to another. The two friends had a great time playing together and sharing their toys.
