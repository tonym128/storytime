Once upon a time, there was a big castle where a king lived. The king was very restless because he wanted to play outside, but it was raining. One day, a little boy came to the castle and asked the king if he wanted to play with him. The king was happy and said, "Yes, I will play with you!"
The little boy and the king played together all day. They ran around the castle and played hide-and-seek. The king was so happy that he forgot about the rain outside. Suddenly, the little boy said, "It's time for me to go home." The king said, "Okay, I will see you tomorrow."
The next day, the little boy came back to the castle and the king was excited to see him. They played together again and had so much fun. The king was no longer restless because he had a new friend to play with and the castle was filled with joy.
