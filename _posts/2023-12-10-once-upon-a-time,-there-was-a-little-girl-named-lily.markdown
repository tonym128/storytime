Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily went to the park with her mommy. At the park, she saw her friend Timmy. Timmy was playing with a ball. 
Lily asked Timmy, "Can I play with you?" 
Timmy said, "Yes, you can play with me. But, you have to push the ball back and forth." 
Lily pushed the ball back and forth with Timmy. She had so much fun! After playing for a while, Lily's mommy gave her a tasty snack. Lily shared her snack with Timmy. 
Timmy said, "This snack is so tasty! Thank you, Lily." 
Lily smiled and said, "You're welcome, Timmy. I'm glad you like it." 
From that day on, Lily and Timmy played together every time they went to the park.
