Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a thick tree. The tree had big, green leaves. A little boy named Tim loved to play around the tree.
One day, Tim found a big shield under the tree. He picked it up and saw a girl named Sue. Sue was sad because her toy box was empty. Tim wanted to help Sue feel happy again.
Tim said, "Let's fill your toy box with toys!" Tim and Sue put many toys in the box. They played together all day. The thick tree and the big shield made them very happy.
