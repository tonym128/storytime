Once upon a time, there was a raven who loved to fly high in the sky. One day, the raven saw a little girl who was playing in the park. The raven felt happy and wanted to play with her too.
The little girl saw the raven and ran towards him. She hugged him tightly and they played together. The raven felt so happy and loved. He felt warm and safe in the little girl's arms.
As the sun began to set, the little girl's mom came to pick her up. The raven said goodbye to the little girl and flew away. The little girl felt sad but also felt happy because she made a new friend. The raven felt happy too and felt tight in his heart.
