Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside, but he was afraid of the dark. One night, Timmy was playing with his friend Billy when they saw a glowing light in the distance.
"Wow, what is that?" Timmy asked.
"I don't know, let's go check it out!" Billy replied.
As they got closer, they saw that the glowing thing was coming from a big, fierce dragon.
"Oh no, it's a dragon!" Timmy cried.
"Don't worry, I have a knife," Billy said, pulling out a small knife from his pocket.
Billy bravely approached the dragon and cut it in half with his knife. The dragon roared in anger, but Billy explained that he just wanted to make friends.
The dragon was surprised by the brave gesture and decided to be friends with Timmy and Billy. From that day on, they played together every night, and the dragon would always glow with joy whenever they saw it.
