Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy was feeling sick, so his mommy took his temperature with a thermometer. The thermometer was a stick that beeped when it was done. 
Timmy's mommy looked at the thermometer and saw that Timmy had a fever. She gave him some medicine to make him feel better. Timmy drank the medicine and then went to bed.
Later that night, Timmy heard a noise outside his window. He got scared and called out to his mommy. She came running and told him not to be afraid, it was just the wind. Timmy felt better and went back to sleep.
