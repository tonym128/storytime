Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to play outside in his backyard. One day, he found a big pit in the ground. It was very deep and he couldn't see the bottom. 
Timmy decided to fill the pit with dirt to see how big it was. He used his shovel to scoop up the dirt and put it in a pile. He did this over and over again until the pit was very big. 
But then, Timmy had an idea. He wanted to make the pit even bigger! He asked his dad to help him add more water to the pit. His dad said yes and they added more water to the pit. 
Suddenly, the pit became very popular in Timmy's neighborhood. Lots of kids started to come and play in it. Timmy was very happy because he had made the pit even more fun for everyone to play in.
