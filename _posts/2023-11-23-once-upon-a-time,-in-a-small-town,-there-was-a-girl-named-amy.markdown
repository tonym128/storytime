Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a girl named Amy. Amy was a very organized girl. She liked to keep her toys and books in the right place. One day, Amy's mom gave her a pretty veil for her doll's hair. Amy was very happy and said, "Thank you, mom!"
Amy wanted to display her doll and veil for everyone to see. She put the veil on the doll's head and smiled. Then, she put the doll on the table. "Look, mom! My doll looks so pretty!" she said. Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, she does, Amy! You did a great job!"
Amy felt very proud of her doll and her veil. She played with her doll and took good care of her. She made sure everything was organized and clean. Amy and her doll had many fun days together, and they lived happily ever after.
