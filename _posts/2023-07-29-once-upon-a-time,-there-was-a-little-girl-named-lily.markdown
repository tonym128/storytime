Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily had a lamp in her room that she loved very much. One day, Lily's lamp broke and she was very sad. She went to her mommy and said, "Mommy, my lamp is broken. Can you fix it?" Her mommy said, "Yes, Lily. I will fix it for you."
While her mommy was fixing the lamp, Lily played with her toys. But then, she heard a scary noise outside. She looked out the window and saw a big monster! Lily was very scared and didn't know what to do. She ran to her mommy and said, "Mommy, there's a monster outside! What should we do?"
Her mommy said, "Don't worry, Lily. I will handle the monster and make sure it's not scary." Her mommy went outside with a broom and sprayed it with water. The monster saw the water and ran away. Lily was happy that her mommy was able to handle the scary monster.
