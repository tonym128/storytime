Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she went to the park with her mommy. They played on the swings and the slide. 
Suddenly, Lily's mommy said, "It's getting late, we have to come home. Are you ready to go?" 
Lily said, "Yes mommy!" and they walked home together. When they got home, Lily's mommy said, "It's time for your bath. Let's store your toys in the toy box." 
Lily picked up her dolls and put them in the toy box. Then she said, "Mommy, can I take a bath now?" 
Her mommy smiled and said, "Of course, let's go to the bathroom." After her bath, Lily put on her pajamas and climbed into bed. Her mommy read her a story and then she fell asleep with a smile on her face.
