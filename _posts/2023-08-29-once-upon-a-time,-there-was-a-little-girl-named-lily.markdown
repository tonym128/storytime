Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved ice cream and her mom kept it in the freezer. One day, Lily went to get some ice cream but the freezer was empty. She was very sad.
Lily asked her mom, "Where is the ice cream?" Her mom replied, "We finished it all. It's all gone now." Lily was very serious and said, "What are we going to do? I really wanted ice cream."
Her mom said, "Don't worry, we can make our own ice cream together." Lily was happy and they made some ice cream. But when they took it out of the freezer, they saw that it had melted. Lily was very upset and said, "Now we can't eat ice cream anymore." Her mom replied, "It's okay, we can try again next time." And they both smiled.
