Once upon a time, there was a bald man named Tom. Tom loved to play with his friends in the park. One day, Tom found a small box with a lock. He was very curious about what was inside the box. He asked his friends to help him open the lock, but they could not. Tom decided to keep the box safe until he could find the key.
Days went by, and Tom did not find the key. He was sad and thought about the box. One day, while playing in the park, he saw a key on the ground. He picked it up and thought it might open the lock. Tom was very excited and ran back to his house to try the key.
Tom tried the key on the lock, and it opened! Inside the box, he found a beautiful necklace. He was so happy that he decided to give it to his mom as a gift. His mom was very proud of him for keeping the necklace safe. Tom learned that keeping things safe and trying hard can bring happiness.
