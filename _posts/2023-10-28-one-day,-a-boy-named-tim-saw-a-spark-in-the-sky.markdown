One day, a boy named Tim saw a spark in the sky. It was a pretty spark, and it made him feel happy. He wanted to show his friend, Sue, the spark.
"Look, Sue! A spark!" Tim said.
Sue looked up and saw the spark too. They both felt very happy. But then, something unexpected happened. The spark started to change. It became bigger and bigger. Tim and Sue started to feel uncomfortable. They stepped back and watched the spark.
As the spark changed, it turned into a big, friendly dragon! The dragon said, "Hello, Tim and Sue! I am a magic dragon. Thank you for finding me. Now, let's all play together!"
Tim and Sue were surprised, but they felt happy again. They played with the magic dragon all day and had lots of fun.
