Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pretty picture of her family at the hospital. She wanted to give it to them as a gift. So, she asked her mom to help her mail it. 
Mom was a strong helper and she loved making Lily happy. She put the picture in an envelope and they walked to the mailbox. Lily put the envelope inside and raised the red flag. 
A few days later, Lily's family got the picture in the mail. They were so happy and proud of their little girl. They hung the picture on the fridge and it looked so good. Lily felt happy too, knowing her family loved her gift.
