Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in nature. She would pick flowers and chase butterflies. One day, Lily was playing in the park when it started to rain. She was sad because she couldn't play outside anymore.
As she was walking home, she saw a little bird sitting on the ground. The bird looked sad and was shivering. Lily felt compassionate and wanted to help the bird. She remembered that her mommy always told her to be kind to animals. So, she picked up the bird and took it home.
When they got home, Lily's mommy was surprised to see the bird. Lily explained what happened and her mommy was proud of her for being so kind. They put the bird in a warm and cozy place and gave it some food. The next day, the bird was feeling better and it flew away. Lily was happy that she could help the bird and she learned that being compassionate can make a big difference.
