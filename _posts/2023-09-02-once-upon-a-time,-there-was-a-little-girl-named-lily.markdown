Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to sleep with her cozy blanket every night. One day, Lily's mommy wanted to test which blanket was the softest. She put it on the couch and started to rub it gently with her hands.
Lily watched her mommy and then asked, "Mommy, can I test my blanket too?"
Her mommy smiled and said, "Of course you can, Lily! Let's see which one is the softest."
Lily and her mommy both tested their blankets and found out that Lily's blanket was the softest. They hugged and Lily said, "I love my soft blanket!"
