Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to take baths in his big, white bathtub. One day, Tim's mommy said, "Tim, we need to prevent the water from overflowing. Can you turn the tap off for me?" Tim tried to turn the tap on, but it was weak and wouldn't work. 
"I can't do it, Mommy. The tap is weak," Tim said. 
"It's okay, Tim. I'll call the plumber to help us. He's very good at fixing things and we need his help," Mommy said. 
The plumber came and fixed the tap, and Tim was very happy. He said, "Thank you, Mr. Plumber! Now I can take baths and not worry about the water overflowing." And so, Tim happily took his bath, feeling clean and refreshed.
