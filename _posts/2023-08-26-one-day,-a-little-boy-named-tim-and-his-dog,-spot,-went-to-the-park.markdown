One day, a little boy named Tim and his dog, Spot, went to the park. They loved to play together. Tim would throw a ball and Spot would run to get it. They played and played all day long.
"Spot, I love playing with you!" said Tim. Spot barked happily and wagged his tail. But then, Tim saw a big tree with a scary face on it. He was afraid. "I don't want to play here, Spot," said Tim. Spot barked and tried to comfort Tim. "Don't be scared, Tim!" Spot barked.
Suddenly, the scary face on the tree disappeared! But it was not Tim's face on Spot. It was a friendly squirrel! The squirrel had been playing hide and seek. Tim and Spot laughed. They were not scared anymore. They played with the squirrel and had a lot of fun at the park.
