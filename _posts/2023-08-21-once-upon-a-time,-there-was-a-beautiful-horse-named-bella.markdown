Once upon a time, there was a beautiful horse named Bella. Bella lived in a big field with her friends. They liked to run and play all day.
One sunny day, Bella saw a little girl named Lily. Lily was sad. Bella wanted to help. She walked to Lily and whispered, "Why are you sad?"
Lily looked at Bella and said, "I lost my ball. Can you help me find it?" Bella nodded her head and they both started to look for the ball. They looked under the trees and behind the bushes. Finally, they found the ball near a big rock.
Lily was very happy and hugged Bella. She said, "Thank you, Bella! You are the best horse ever!" They played together all day long and became the best of friends. From that day on, Bella and Lily always played together in the big field.
