Once upon a time, in a big forest, there lived a little deer. The little deer liked to play with his friends. They would run and jump all day long.
One day, while playing, the little deer saw a big tree. He wanted to lean on the tree to rest. As he leaned on the tree, he heard a loud noise. The little deer was scared.
But then, something unexpected happened. The big tree was not a tree at all! It was a giant, friendly bear who was just sleeping. The bear woke up and smiled at the little deer. They became best friends and played together in the forest every day.
