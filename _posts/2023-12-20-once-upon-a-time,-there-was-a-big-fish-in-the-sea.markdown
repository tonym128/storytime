Once upon a time, there was a big fish in the sea. The fish was very happy swimming around in the water. One day, the fish saw a shiny thing in the water. It was a trade! The fish wanted the trade very much.
The fish asked the other fish in the sea if they had anything to trade for the shiny thing. But no one had anything. So, the fish decided to dive down to the bottom of the sea to look for something to trade.
As the fish was swimming down, it saw a big rock. The fish thought the rock might have something shiny inside. The fish dove down and found a shiny necklace. The fish was so happy! 
But as the fish was swimming back up, it got stuck in a fishing net. The fish tried and tried to get free, but it couldn't. The fish was very sad and scared. It wished it had never tried to trade something so expensive.
