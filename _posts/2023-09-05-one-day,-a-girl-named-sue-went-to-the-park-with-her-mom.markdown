One day, a girl named Sue went to the park with her mom. They had a big bag with them. In the bag, there were many yummy things to eat. They also had a cooler with them. The cooler was tight, but Sue did not know that.
At the park, Sue saw a boy named Tim. Tim was playing with a ball. Sue wanted to play too. They played together and had lots of fun. Then, Sue's mom opened the cooler to give them food and drinks. But the cooler was not full yet. Sue's mom was worried that they would not have enough food for everyone.
Sue had an idea. She said, "Let's make the food increase!" Sue and Tim put more food in the cooler. They found more yummy things to put in the cooler. Soon, the cooler was full again. Everyone was happy, and they all enjoyed the food. Sue and Tim kept playing and became good friends.
