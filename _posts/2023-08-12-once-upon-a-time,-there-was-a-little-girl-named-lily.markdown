Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily went outside to play in the snow. She put on her warm coat and boots, and went outside to build a snowman. 
As she was building her snowman, she saw a rope lying on the ground. She picked it up and started to swing it around. Suddenly, she heard a voice behind her. It was her friend, Jack. 
"Hi Lily, what are you doing?" Jack asked. 
"I'm swinging this rope," Lily replied. 
Jack looked at the cold snowman and said, "It's very icy today. I hope your snowman doesn't freeze." 
Lily smiled and said, "Don't worry, Jack. I'll make sure my snowman doesn't freeze. And I wonder if I can rope the rope to make a swing for us to play on." 
Jack was excited and they spent the rest of the day playing with the rope and swinging on the snowy hill.
