Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in her backyard. One day, she saw a big, tall tree. It was leaning to one side and looked like it might fall down. 
Lily was curious about the tree, so she went closer to take a look. Suddenly, she heard a noise coming from the tree. It sounded like a little bird chirping! 
Lily was so excited to see the bird, but she didn't know that it was sick. She was ignorant of how the bird was feeling. She wanted to help the bird, so she called her mommy and they took the bird to the vet. 
The vet made the bird feel better and Lily learned that sometimes we need to ask questions and not just do whatever we want. She also learned that trees need to be careful and lean to one side, like the tree did. From that day on, Lily made sure to always take care of the trees and animals in her backyard.
