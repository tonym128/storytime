Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play outside. One day, she saw a cute little puppy and she wanted to pet it. But when she got close, the puppy bit her finger! It hurt a lot and Lily started to cry.
Her mom came running over and asked, "What happened, Lily?" Lily said, "The puppy bit me and it hurts." Her mom looked at her finger and saw that it was red and swollen. She said, "Let's go inside and clean it up."
When they went inside, Lily's big brother came in and asked what happened. Lily was still crying and her brother said, "Don't worry, Lily. I'll go get the puppy's owner and he can help us." Lily's brother went outside and talked to his neighbor. He told them about the puppy and the owner. Soon, the owner came over and helped clean the puppy's paw. Lily felt better and thanked her brother for helping her.
