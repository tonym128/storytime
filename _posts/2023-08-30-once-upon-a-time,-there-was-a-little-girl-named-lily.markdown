Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing outside and looking at the bright flowers. One day, she saw an ugly bug crawling on the ground. 
"Mommy, look at this ugly bug!" Lily said, pointing at it. 
"That's not very nice, Lily. We should leave it alone," her mom replied. 
Lily agreed and continued playing, but as the sun started to set, she looked up at the sky and saw the beautiful sunset. 
"Mommy, look at the pretty colors in the sky!" Lily said, pointing at the sunset. 
"Yes, it's very pretty," her mom said, smiling. 
Lily felt happy and content as she watched the sunset until it was time to go inside for bed.
