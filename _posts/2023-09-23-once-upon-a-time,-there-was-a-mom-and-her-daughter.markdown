Once upon a time, there was a mom and her daughter. They lived in a small house. The daughter loved to play with her toys and make a big mess. One day, the mom said, "Daughter, your room is very messy. Let's clean it up."
While they were cleaning, the mom found a pretty toy that could glow. She showed it to her daughter and said, "Look, this toy can glow at night. It is so fun to play with when it is dark."
That night, the daughter took the glowing toy to bed with her. The toy made her room glow with a soft light. She was so happy and said, "Thank you, mom, for showing me the glowing toy. I love it!"
The mom smiled and said, "You're welcome, my little star. Now you know the importance of keeping your room clean." And from that day on, the daughter always made sure her room was clean and her toys were dry.
