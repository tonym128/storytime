Once upon a time, in a small house, there lived a boy named Tim. Tim had an amazing toy. It was a red car. He loved to play with his car all day.
One day, Tim saw a big TV in the living room. He thought it would be fun to make his car go fast on the TV. He pushed the car very hard, but it did not move. Tim tried again and again, but the car still would not go fast on the TV.
Tim's mom saw him trying hard and said, "Tim, pushing the car on the TV is not nice. It might break something." Tim did not listen to his mom. He pushed the car harder, and then, the car hit the TV. The TV fell down and broke. Tim was very sad.
Mom said, "I told you not to push the car on the TV. Now the TV is broken, and we cannot watch our favorite shows." Tim knew he should have listened to his mom. He felt bad for not listening. The day ended sadly because Tim did not listen to his mom.
