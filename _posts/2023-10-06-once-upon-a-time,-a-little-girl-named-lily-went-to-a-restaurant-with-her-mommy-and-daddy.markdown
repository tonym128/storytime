Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily went to a restaurant with her mommy and daddy. They sat down at a table and looked at the menu. Lily saw a picture of a yummy cheeseburger and said, "I want that one, please!" 
The waiter came over and asked, "What can I get for you?" Lily said, "I want a cheeseburger and fries, please!" The waiter smiled and said, "Good choice, I'll bring it to you soon." 
After a few minutes, Lily's cheeseburger arrived. She took a big bite and said, "Mmm, this is so fine!" Her mommy and daddy smiled and said, "We're glad you like it, Lily." 
Lily finished her cheeseburger and fries and said, "I'm full, but I want to come back to this restaurant again!" Her mommy and daddy laughed and said, "Maybe we can come back anytime you want, Lily."
