Once upon a time, there was a little toy car named Tim. Tim was very sad because he had a big broken wheel. He could not move fast like the other toy cars. One day, Tim met a little toy girl named Sue. Sue saw that Tim was sad and wanted to help.
Sue said, "Don't worry, Tim! I will help you fix your broken wheel, and then you can feel happy again." Tim was so happy to hear this. Sue took Tim to her room and found a big, round screw. She put the screw in the broken wheel, and it was fixed!
Now that Tim's wheel was fixed, he started to feel very happy. He could move fast like the other toy cars! Tim and Sue played together all day long. From that day on, Tim and Sue became the best of friends.
