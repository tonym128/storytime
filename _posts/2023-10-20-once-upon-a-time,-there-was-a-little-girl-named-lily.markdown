Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and run around outside. One day, she went to the park to play with her friend, Max.
"Hi Max!" said Lily.
"Hi Lily!" said Max. "Do you want to play on the swings?"
"Yes, please!" said Lily.
They ran over to the swings and started to play. Suddenly, Lily saw a bird flying in the sky.
"Look Max! A bird!" said Lily.
"Wow, it's so high!" said Max.
After a while, Lily had to go home. She said goodbye to Max and went to get her binoculars. She looked through them and saw the bird up close. "I saw it! It's so pretty!" said Lily.
Max said, "I believe you saw it!"
Lily smiled and said, "I did! Thank you for playing with me, Max."
