One day, Tom and Sue went to play in the park. They saw a big tree and wanted to act like monkeys. So, they put on monkey hats and jumped from tree to tree. They were having so much fun.
But then, they saw a little bird stuck in the tree. The bird was wearing a fake wing with a hook on it. Tom and Sue wanted to help the bird. They tried to pull the hook away from the bird's wing, but it was stuck.
Tom and Sue worked together to get the hook out. They pulled and pulled until the hook came off. The little bird was free and flew away happily. Tom and Sue felt good that they helped the bird. They went back to playing and had a great day.
