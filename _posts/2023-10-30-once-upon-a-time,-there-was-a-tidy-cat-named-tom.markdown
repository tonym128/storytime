Once upon a time, there was a tidy cat named Tom. Tom lived in a small house with his friend, a little girl named Sue. Every evening, Tom would always stay in the same space in Sue's room. He liked to sleep there because it was quiet and he could hear Sue playing with her toys.
One evening, while Tom was sleeping, he heard a strange sound. It was a soft, sweet sound that he had never heard before. He looked around and saw a big, shiny box in the corner of the room. Tom was curious and decided to go closer to the box.
As he got closer, the box suddenly opened, and out came a small, friendly dog named Max. At first, Tom was scared, but then he saw that Max was very nice. They played together all night and had lots of fun. From that day on, Tom and Max were the best of friends, and Tom learned that sometimes unexpected things can bring new and wonderful surprises.
