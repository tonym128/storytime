Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tweety. Tweety loved to fly around and sing songs to all his friends. One day, Tweety saw a big, dark cloud in the sky. He knew it was going to rain soon.
Tweety flew to his friend, a little mouse named Jerry, and told him about the cloud. "Jerry, we need to find a safe place to hide from the rain," Tweety said. "I know just the place," Jerry replied. He led Tweety to a tree with a big hole in it. "We'll go in here," Jerry said.
As they crawled inside the tree, they heard someone whispering orders. It was the squirrel, Mr. Nutty. "You must stay here until the rain stops," he said. "No, we can't," Tweety said. "The rain is harmless and we need to stay safe." Then they listened to the squirrel's orders and waited until the rain stopped. When they came out of the tree, they saw that everything was wet, but they were happy they had listened to the squirrel's orders.
