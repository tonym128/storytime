Once upon a time there was a little girl called Poppy. She was only three years old, but she had a big dream. She wanted to be a fast runner! So every day, Poppy would run all around the park, practice running as fast as she could.
One day, Poppy chose to go to the library. She wanted to read about running races. When she got there, Poppy was so excited. She looked around the library until she found the perfect book. It was full of pictures and words about running fast.
Poppy read the book and couldn't wait to try running like the cheetahs in the story. She was determined to become a fast runner. She ran around the library, up and down the stairs, and all the way around the park.
But no matter how fast Poppy ran, she couldn't seem to keep up with the other runners. She was tired and sad.
But then Poppy remembered something her mum had said: 'When something doesn't go your way, try again!'. So Poppy decided to try again the next day.
And sure enough, Poppy ran even faster than before! She felt so proud of herself that she laughed
