Once upon a time, a little boy named Tim had a big book. The book was full of history. He loved to read it every day. One day, while reading, he heard a voice. The voice said, "Hello, Tim. I am the history book. I can talk to you."
Tim was very surprised. He said, "Wow, you can talk! That is amazing. I would love to hear a story from you. But, you must be serious. A story about a bad man who breaks everything."
The history book said, "Okay, Tim. I will tell you a story about a bad man who broke many things. He was not nice, and no one liked him."
Tim listened to the history book's story. He learned about the bad man who broke many things. Tim said, "Thank you for the story, history book. I will be serious when I read you."
From that day on, Tim and the history book became good friends. Tim was serious when he read the history book, and the book was always there to tell him stories.
