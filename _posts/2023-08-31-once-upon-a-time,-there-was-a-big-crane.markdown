Once upon a time, there was a big crane. The crane was very tall and had a long neck. It liked to lift heavy things and move them around. One day, the crane saw something unusual. It was a big rock that didn't fit in with the others. The crane tried to lift the rock, but it was too heavy. 
The crane decided to ask for help. It saw a little mouse and asked, "Can you help me lift this unusual rock?" The mouse said yes and together they lifted the rock and moved it to a new spot. The crane was very happy and thanked the mouse for its help. From that day on, the crane and the mouse became good friends and helped each other whenever they could.
