Once upon a time, there was a wealthy man who had a big car. He loved his car very much. One day, he went for a ride in his car. He saw a little boy playing with a toy car. The little boy looked sad.
The wealthy man stopped his car and asked the little boy, "Why are you sad? Do you want to play with my car?" The little boy looked at the car and smiled. "Yes, please! I love cars too," he said. The wealthy man was happy to share his car with the little boy.
As they played, the wealthy man stumble on a big rock. His car made a loud noise. Suddenly, the car started to fly in the air! The little boy laughed and clapped his hands. The wealthy man and the little boy flew around in the sky, having the best time ever. The car was no longer just a toy, but a magical flying car!
