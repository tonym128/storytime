Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny loved to play in the grass with his friends. One day, Benny saw a big carrot in the grass and he wanted to catch it. 
Benny hopped and hopped, but he couldn't catch the carrot. Suddenly, he heard a voice behind him. "Hello, Benny!" It was his friend, Sammy the squirrel. "That carrot looks harmless. Can I have it?"
Benny didn't want to fight with Sammy, so he said, "Sure, Sammy. You can have the carrot." Benny felt happy that he could share with his friend. 
Later that day, Benny and Sammy were playing on the ground when they saw a big shadow. Benny was scared, but Sammy said, "Don't worry, Benny. That's just a bird." They watched the bird fly away and felt safe again. Benny learned that sometimes things that may seem scary can turn out okay in the end.
