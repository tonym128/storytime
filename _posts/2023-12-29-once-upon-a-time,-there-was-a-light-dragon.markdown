Once upon a time, there was a light dragon. He lived in a big cave. The dragon was big and green. He had many friends, but he wanted to find a new friend.
One day, the dragon went for a walk. He saw a small cat. The cat was scared. The dragon said, "Don't be scared, I want to be your friend." The cat looked at the dragon and said, "You are big and green. I am small and white."
The dragon started to worry. He thought, "What if my big eyes scare my new friend?" He talked to the cat every day. They played and had fun. The dragon was happy.
One day, the dragon saw a big tree. He wanted to climb it. The cat saw the dragon and said, "Be careful! You might get stuck." The dragon listened to the cat and did not climb the tree.
The dragon and the cat were still best friends. They were happy and never worry again.
