Once upon a time, there was a bunny named Benny. Benny loved to eat carrots. One day, Benny saw a carrot that looked different from the others. It was an original carrot! Benny wanted to take a bite, but he noticed that it was attached to a string. 
Benny thought it was strange that a carrot could be attached to something like that. He decided to pull the carrot away, but it was too heavy. He asked his friend, a squirrel named Sammy, to help him. Together, they pulled the carrot until it finally came loose.
As Benny bit into the carrot, he realized that it tasted even better than the bunch he had before. He was happy that he didn't give up and was able to enjoy the original carrot. From then on, Benny always looked for original carrots to eat.
