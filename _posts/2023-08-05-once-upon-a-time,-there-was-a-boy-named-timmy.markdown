Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and run around. One day, he saw his friend Billy playing with a ball. 
"Can I play with you?" asked Timmy.
"Sure!" said Billy. "Let's see who can throw the ball the farthest."
Timmy threw the ball as hard as he could and it went very far. Billy was impressed. "Wow, you're really good at throwing!"
Suddenly, Timmy saw something shiny on the ground. "Look, Billy! There's glue over there. Let's use it to make a picture!"
They picked up the glue and started gluing different shapes together. They made a beautiful picture of a bird. 
After they finished, Timmy's mom came outside and saw the picture. "That's amazing!" she said. "You two are so good at making things together. I'm proud of you."
Timmy and Billy smiled and felt happy. They knew they had done something special.
