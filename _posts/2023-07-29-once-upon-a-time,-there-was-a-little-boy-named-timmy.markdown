Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to play outside and explore. One day, he went for a walk near a stream. He saw a fish swimming in the stream and wanted to catch it. 
But Timmy's mom said, "Be careful, Timmy. The stream is not easy to catch fish like this. You need to enjoy the walk and not get too excited."
Timmy listened to his mom and walked carefully. He saw some rocks by the stream and decided to collect them instead. He put them in a bucket and went back home. 
When he got home, Timmy showed his mom the rocks he collected. She was very happy and proud of him. Timmy learned that it's important to enjoy the walk and not get too excited.
