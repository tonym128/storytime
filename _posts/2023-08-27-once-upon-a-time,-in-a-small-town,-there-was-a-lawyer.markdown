Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a lawyer. He was a bit weird. He liked to give things to people. He gave toys, food, and clothes to people who needed them.
One day, the lawyer met a little girl. She was sad because she lost her toy. The lawyer wanted to help her. So, he gave her a new toy. The girl was very happy.
The weird lawyer felt good. He liked to give and help others. From that day on, he gave more and more things to people in his town. Everyone loved the weird lawyer. And they all lived happily ever after.
