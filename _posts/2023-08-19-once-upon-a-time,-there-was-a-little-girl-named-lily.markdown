Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her favorite toy was a small red ball. One day, Lily's mom asked her to help in the kitchen. Lily was excited to help her mom, so she went to the kitchen.
Lily's mom asked her to lift a glass of water from the faucet. Lily tried to lift the glass, but it was too heavy for her. She tried again, but she still couldn't lift it. Suddenly, Lily's red ball bounced into the kitchen and hit the glass. The glass fell and broke into many pieces.
Lily was scared and started to cry. Her mom hugged her and told her that accidents happen and it's okay. They cleaned up the mess together and Lily felt better. From that day on, Lily learned to be more careful when she lifted things in the kitchen.
