Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Linda. Linda always wanted to be the best, so she kept trying to do things better than her friends.
One day, Linda saw a tasty looking pie on the kitchen table. It looked so good that she took it without asking. She quickly gobbled it up and was so happy.
But when the lifeguard saw what she did, he was very angry. He said that Linda had done something wrong and she had to be punished.
Linda was so frightened that she couldn't even speak. The lifeguard said it was because she had taken a tasty pie without asking. He said she would be punished for a long time.
So, Linda had to go to the hospital and was not allowed to come back home.
The moral of the story is that when someone tells you to do something wrong, it is important to listen and obey. If you do not, you will be punished and you will have a bad ending.
