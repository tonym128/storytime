Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, they were playing with a ball when suddenly it rolled into a net. The net was big and strong, but it was also very good at catching things.
Lily went to get the ball, and when she looked inside the net, she saw a surprise! There was a little bird inside, and it looked hurt. Lily knew she had to help the bird, so she carefully took it out of the net.
She called her mommy to come and pick the bird up. They took it to the vet and made sure it was okay. Lily was very happy that she could help the bird, and she felt good inside because she did the right thing.
