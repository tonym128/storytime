Once upon a time, there was a dog named Max. Max loved to play in the park. One day, Max's owner gave him a ball. Max was so happy! He ran and ran until he found a big stick. Max put the stick in his mouth and ran back to his owner. 
Max's owner gave him some food and Max ate it all up. His owner said, "Max, you need to eat your regular food. It's good for you." Max wagged his tail and barked happily. He loved to eat his regular food! 
After Max finished eating, he went back to play with his stick. He ran and ran until he found a big pile of leaves. Max jumped in the leaves and put his stick in the pile. He barked, "Look, Mom! I put my stick in the leaves!" Max's owner smiled and said, "Good job, Max!" Max was so happy that he could play with his stick and he ate his regular food too. The end.
