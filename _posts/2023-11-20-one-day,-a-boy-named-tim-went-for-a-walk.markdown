One day, a boy named Tim went for a walk. He saw a rare, big red ball in the sky. Tim wanted to touch the ball, but it was too far away. He thought of a plan to reach the ball.
Tim found a ladder and put it against a tree. He started to climb the ladder, but then he heard a voice say, "Stop! Don't climb the tree!" Tim looked around and saw a little bird on a branch. The bird said, "This is my home. If you come up, I will lose my eggs."
Tim stopped and thought about it. He didn't want the bird to lose her eggs. He said, "I won't climb your tree. I just want to touch the big red ball in the sky." The bird thanked Tim and flew up to the ball.
After a while, the bird came back to Tim and said, "The ball is higher now. You can't touch it. You can only look at it." Tim smiled and thanked the bird for helping him. He climbed down the ladder and went home, happy that he didn't touch the rare big red ball in the sky.
