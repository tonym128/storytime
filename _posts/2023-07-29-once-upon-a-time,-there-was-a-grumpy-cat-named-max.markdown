Once upon a time, there was a grumpy cat named Max. Max lived in a small house with a girl named Lily. Lily loved Max, but Max did not like to play with Lily. One day, Lily felt sick and her mom had to take her to the hospital.
At the hospital, Lily met a nurse named Sarah. Sarah was nice and made Max feel better. Max's paw got better, and he even played with Sarah. "Max, you can go home now," said Sarah. Max was happy, so he followed Sarah home.
When they got home, Max saw a big box in the living room. He was curious and jumped inside. Lily heard Max and came inside too. "Max, come out!" she said. Max tried to escape, but he could not. Suddenly, the box opened, and Max vanished. Lily's mom was surprised and said, "Silly Max, he was just playing hide and seek!" Lily laughed, and they all played together until it was time for Max to be a grumpy cat again.
