Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim lived in a small house with his mom and dad. In the house, there was a fireplace where Tim liked to sit and play with his toys.
One day, Tim's mom asked him to help with the dishes. "Tim, can you soak the plates in water for me?" she asked. Tim was very excited to help, but he was also a little anxious. He had never done this before.
As Tim was soaking the plates, his dog, Spot, came running into the room. Spot jumped on the table and knocked over the Grandma's tea cup. Tim's mom saw what happened and said, "Oh no, Spot! Be more careful!" Tim felt bad for worried his mom. But his mom just laughed and said, "It's okay, we can all have a tea party now!" So, Tim, his mom, dad, and Spot all sat by the fireplace and had a fun tea party together.
