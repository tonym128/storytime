Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to drink tea with her mom every day. One day, her mom made a special tea that was very powerful.
Lily asked her mom, "What is powerful?" Her mom replied, "It means it can make you feel very strong or powerful."
Lily took a sip of the special tea and suddenly felt a burst of energy. She said to her mom, "This tea is so powerful that it makes me run super fast!"
Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, it does. But remember, it's not always about being powerful. It's about listening to your body and taking care of yourself."
Lily learned that even though the tea was powerful, it was important to drink it wisely and take care of herself. From that day on, she always drank her tea carefully and listened to her body.
