Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the park with her mom. They saw a big orange on the ground. Lily said, "Mommy, can I have that orange?" Her mom said, "Sure, you can choose it if you want." Lily picked up the orange and said, "It's so big and juicy!" Her mom said, "It's also a little rough, so be careful." Lily took a bite and said, "Yummy! This orange is delicious!"
