Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved playing with his toy cars and trucks. One day, he found a big box in his backyard. He was curious and wondered what was inside.
Timmy asked his mom, "What's in the box?" His mom replied, "I don't know, let's open it and find out!" They opened the box and found a shiny steel chain. Timmy thought it looked cool and wanted to touch it. But suddenly, the chain started to shake and move all by itself!
Timmy and his mom were surprised and scared. They didn't know what to do. The chain turned into a big steel robot! The robot looked grumpy and didn't say anything. But then, the robot started to move and dance. Timmy and his mom were amazed and started to laugh. The robot became their new friend and they played together every day.
