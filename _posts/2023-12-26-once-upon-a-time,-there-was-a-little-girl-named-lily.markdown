Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in her backyard, which had a big hedge. One day, Lily's mom asked her if she wanted to help make a garden. Lily was very excited and said yes.
Lily's mom recommended that they dig a hole in the hedge to plant some flowers. Lily helped her mom dig the hole and put the flowers in. They watered the flowers every day and waited patiently for them to grow.
One day, Lily saw a butterfly in the hedge. She tried to catch it, but it flew away. Lily was sad, but her mom told her that the butterfly had a healthy life in the hedge and that it was important to let it live in peace.
Lily felt better and decided to include butterflies in her garden from now on. She learned that it's important to respect nature and let it live happily.
