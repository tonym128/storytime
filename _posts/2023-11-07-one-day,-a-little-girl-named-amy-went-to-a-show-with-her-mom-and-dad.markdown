One day, a little girl named Amy went to a show with her mom and dad. At the show, they saw people sing and dance. When the show was over, everyone clapped and cheered. Amy liked the show a lot. It was an opera.
Amy wanted to do something great on her own. She thought of a plan. She wanted to act in the show too. But first, she needed to find something useful to wear. She looked in her room and found a pretty dress and shiny shoes. She put them on and felt very special.
The day of the show came back. Amy was ready to act. She wore her pretty dress and shiny shoes. At the show, everyone clapped and cheered. When Amy came out, all the people were so happy. They all put on their own special things and watched the opera together. It was a great day for everyone.
