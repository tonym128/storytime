Once upon a time, there was a gray cat. The cat loved to eat popcorn. One day, the cat went to the kitchen to find some popcorn.
The cat found a big bowl of popcorn on the table. The cat was very happy. It started to eat the popcorn very fast. The cat wanted to finish the popcorn before it was all gone.
But then, the cat ate too much popcorn. It started to feel sick. The cat ate so much popcorn that it could not move. In the end, the gray cat was very sad and sick because it ate too much popcorn.
