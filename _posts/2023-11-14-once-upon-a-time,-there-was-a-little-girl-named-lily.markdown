Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to dance and listen to music. One day, her mommy brought home a big box. Lily was excited to see what was inside.
Mommy said, "Let's open it together!" They lifted the lid and inside was a big, shiny box. Lily opened it up and inside was a brand new music box. She was so excited to dance to the new music.
Lily turned on the music and started to dance. But then something unexpected happened. The music box started to shake and rattle. Suddenly, it flew out of Lily's hands and landed on the floor. Out popped a tiny mouse! The mouse had been hiding in the music box and got so excited to be free. Lily and her mommy were surprised but they were happy to help the little mouse. They opened up a cozy place for the mouse to live and danced to his music all night long.
