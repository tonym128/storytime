Once upon a time, there was a big mountain. On the mountain, there was a small house. In the house, lived a boy named Tim and his mom. They were very happy. One day, Tim saw a ball in the sky. It was the sun. The sun would rise every day.
"Mom, look!" Tim said. "The sun is rising! It is so pretty!" His mom looked at the sky and smiled. "Yes, Tim. The sun is rising. It is a good day for a walk."
Tim and his mom went for a walk on the mountain. They saw many trees, flowers, and animals. They saw a big, spicy-smelling flower. Tim picked it up and smelled it. "Mom, it smells spicy!" he said. His mom laughed and said, "That's a special flower, Tim. It will make our walk more fun!"
They walked and walked, and the sun kept rising. Tim and his mom had a great day on the mountain. They saw many new things and had lots of fun. When they went back home, they put the spicy flower in their garden. It made their days even more special.
