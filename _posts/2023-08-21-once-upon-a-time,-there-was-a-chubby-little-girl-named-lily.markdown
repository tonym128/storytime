Once upon a time, there was a chubby little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, Lily and her friends went for a walk in the park. They saw a big mountain and Lily wanted to climb it. 
Lily said, "I want to climb that mountain!" 
Her friends said, "We can't climb it, we're too small." 
Lily felt sad because she really wanted to climb the mountain. Suddenly, a friendly dog came up to her and said, "I can help you climb the mountain!" 
Lily was surprised and happy. She followed the dog up the mountain and they reached the top. From there, they could see the whole park. Lily was happy and grateful to the dog for helping her.
