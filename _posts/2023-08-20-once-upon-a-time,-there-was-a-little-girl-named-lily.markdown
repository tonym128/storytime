Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a big house with her mommy and daddy. One day, Lily heard a loud noise coming from upstairs. She was scared, so she called for her mommy.
"Mommy, I hear a loud noise upstairs. Can you come and help me?" asked Lily.
Her mommy came upstairs and listened. She heard the noise too and said, "Don't worry, sweetie. It's just the wind outside. It's making a loud noise."
Lily felt better knowing it was just the wind. She hugged her mommy and said, "Thank you for helping me. You're the best!"
