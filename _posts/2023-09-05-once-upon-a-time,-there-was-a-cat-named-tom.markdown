Once upon a time, there was a cat named Tom. Tom liked to eat cream. One day, he saw a big bowl of cream on the table. Tom wanted to eat the cream very much.
Tom jumped on the table and started to drink the cream. But, he did not know that the cream was spicy. Tom's mouth felt hot and he did not like it. He wanted to drink some water to help, but he could not find any.
Tom's friend, a dog named Max, saw Tom on the table. Max knew how to help Tom. Max gave Tom a bowl of water. The story ends with Tom feeling better, and Max telling Tom to be careful with spicy things.
