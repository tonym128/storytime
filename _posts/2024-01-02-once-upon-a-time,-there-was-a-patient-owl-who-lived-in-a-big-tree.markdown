Once upon a time, there was a patient owl who lived in a big tree. The owl loved to watch the stars at night and catch their light. One day, a little bird came to visit the owl and asked him why he liked the night so much. "I like to see the stars twinkle," said the owl. "But sometimes it's too loud and scary."
The little bird was curious and asked the owl to show him how to quiet down the night. The owl thought for a moment and then said, "I have an idea. Let's burn some leaves and make a cozy nest for us to rest in." The little bird thought it was a great idea and they spent the whole day collecting leaves and burning them.
When they had finished, they snuggled up in their new nest and watched the stars twinkle from afar. The little bird was so happy and thanked the owl for his help. "You're a great friend," he said. The owl smiled and said, "I'm happy to help. Now we can enjoy the quiet night together." And they both fell asleep, dreaming of the stars twinkling above them
