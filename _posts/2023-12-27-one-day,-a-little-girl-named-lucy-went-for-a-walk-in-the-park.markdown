One day, a little girl named Lucy went for a walk in the park. She saw an interesting tree with big, red apples. Lucy wanted to pick an apple, so she tried to reach for it. But she was too small and couldn't reach it.
A kind squirrel saw Lucy and said, "I can help you pick the apple!" The squirrel climbed the tree and picked the apple for Lucy. Lucy was very happy and said, "Thank you, squirrel!"
Lucy wanted to share the apple with the squirrel. She took a knife from her bag and cut the apple in half. She gave one half to the squirrel and kept the other half for herself. They both enjoyed the tasty apple together and became good friends. The moral of the story is that sharing makes everyone happy.
