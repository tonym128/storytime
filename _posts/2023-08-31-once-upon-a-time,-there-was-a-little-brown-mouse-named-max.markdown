Once upon a time, there was a little brown mouse named Max. Max lived in a cozy hole in the wall of a big house. One day, Max heard a loud noise coming from outside. He peeked out and saw a big, scary cat appear in the yard.
Max was scared, but he knew he had to stay safe. He ran back to his hole and told his family and friends about the cat. They all worked together to build a strong wall around their hole to protect themselves.
The next day, the cat tried to appear at the yard, but he couldn't get through the wall of Max's house. Max felt safe and happy knowing he had protected his family and friends from the scary cat. From then on, Max made sure to always be on the lookout for any danger that might appear in his woodland home.
