Once upon a time, there was an obedient dog named Spot. Spot loved to play with his lime ball. One day, he saw a cat pass by with his lime ball. Spot was sad and wanted his ball back.
Spot's friend, a bird named Sky, saw that Spot was sad. Sky wanted to help Spot get his lime ball back. So, Sky flew up high and took the lime ball from the cat. The cat and Spot were both surprised.
Spot was very happy to have his lime ball back. But then, something unexpected happened. The cat and Sky started to play with the lime ball together! They became best friends and had lots of fun playing with the lime ball.
