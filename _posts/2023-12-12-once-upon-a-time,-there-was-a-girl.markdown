Once upon a time, there was a girl. She had pink hair and loved to jump. Every day, she would jump and play outside in the sunshine. She had lots of fun!
One day, the girl found a big, pink flower. She was so happy! She wanted to jump and celebrate, so she rushed and ran around the flower. When she was done, she jumped up and down in delight. She laughed and smiled and had the best time.
The girl kept jumping and playing around the pink flower every day. She would always look up at it and give it a big smile. And every time she came across it, she felt so happy and free.
The pink flower was her favorite. Whenever she wanted to jump and play, she would run over and give it a big hug. It was always so nice to cuddle and cuddle! 
The girl and the pink flower were best friends. They would jump, run, and laugh together all day long. They had so much fun and the girl was so happy that she had found her special friend.
