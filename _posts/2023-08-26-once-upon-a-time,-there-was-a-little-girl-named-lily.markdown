Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and color on her desk. One day, she accidentally spilled her water bottle on the desk and it became wet. 
Lily's mom came in and saw the wet desk. "Oh no, Lily! Your desk is wet. We need to dry it off," said her mom. 
Lily helped her mom by holding a towel and wiping the desk dry. As they were cleaning, Lily's mom asked her, "Did you forget to mention our plans for the park tomorrow?" 
Lily thought for a moment and said, "Yes, we are going to the park tomorrow!" Her mom smiled and said, "That's great, Lily. Let's finish cleaning up first." 
After they finished cleaning, Lily and her mom sat on the couch and read a book together. Lily was happy that her desk was dry and she didn't forget about going to the park tomorrow.
