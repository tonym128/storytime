Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a little girl named Sue. She was a fearful girl who was scared of many things. One day, Sue was walking with her mom when they saw a big, black door. Sue wanted to know what was behind the door, but she was too scared to open it.
Sue's mom said, "Let's go see what's behind the door." Sue was scared, but she held her mom's hand and they walked closer to the door. Sue's mom gave her a little slap on the hand and said, "You can do it!"
Sue took a deep breath and opened the door. To her surprise, there was a big, colorful room filled with toys and games! Sue was so happy and not fearful anymore. She played with the toys and had lots of fun. The black door had given her a beautiful place to play and be brave. From that day on, Sue was a brave little girl and was not scared of the black door anymore.
