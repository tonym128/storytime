Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and explore the world around him. One day, Timmy's mom said, "Let's go for a walk in the park!" Timmy was so excited and said, "Yes, let's go!"
As they walked, Timmy saw a big structure made of blocks. He said, "Mommy, look at that big building!" His mom said, "Yes, that's a very kind man who made it." Timmy was curious and asked, "What does kind mean?" His mom explained, "It means he made something for people to use and like."
After their walk, Timmy was tired and wanted to sleep. His mom said, "Let's go home and you can sleep in your bed." Timmy went to bed and fell asleep quickly because he was so tired from his adventure in the park.
