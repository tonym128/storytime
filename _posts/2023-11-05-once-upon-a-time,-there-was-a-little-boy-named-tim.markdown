Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He loved to ride his bike. One day, Tim saw a big truck with lots of ice-cream. He was very happy and wanted to eat some. But the ice-cream was in the truck for a long time. Tim was getting impatient.
Tim's mom told him, "You can have ice-cream, but you need to wait." Tim did not want to wait. He wanted the ice-cream now. He tried to ride his bike, but he was too impatient. He rode his bike faster and faster.
Then, Tim fell off his bike. He was sad and hurt. His mom came to help him. She said, "You should have waited. Now your bike is broken, and you can't ride it anymore." Tim learned that being impatient can lead to bad things.
