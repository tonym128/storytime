Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved going to the gym with his mom. He would run and jump and play with the other kids. One day, Timmy's mom asked him if he wanted to go to a new gym. Timmy said yes, but he didn't like the new gym. It was not as fun as his old gym. 
Timmy's mom was persistent and kept asking him to go to the new gym. She told him that it was important to be healthy and grow strong. Timmy didn't listen and kept saying no. But, his mom knew that Timmy needed to try new things, so she decided to record it on her phone. 
The next time they went to the new gym, Timmy saw that he had lots of fun playing with the other kids. He felt happy and healthy. Timmy learned that it's important to try new things, even if they're not what you're used to.
