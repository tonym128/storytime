Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He had a big wish. He wanted a toy car that he saw in the store. But Tim was poor and did not have enough money to buy the car.
One day, Tim met a kind old man. The old man said, "I can help you get the toy car. But first, you must do something for me." Tim was happy to help. The old man asked Tim to go to the park and find a lost dog. Tim did as the old man asked.
At the park, Tim saw the lost dog. He picked up the dog and took it to the old man. The old man was very happy and said, "You did a good thing. Now, I will give you the toy car." Tim was so happy to receive the toy car from the old man. From that day on, Tim learned that helping others can bring good things to you too.
