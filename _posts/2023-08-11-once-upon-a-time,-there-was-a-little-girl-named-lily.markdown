Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and talk to her friends. One day, she went to the kitchen to get some water and saw her mommy cooking. "What are you making, mommy?" she asked. "I'm making soup, Lily. It's ready to eat," her mommy replied.
Lily went back to her room to play, but she heard a knock on the door. It was her friend, Tommy. "Can I come in and play with you, Lily?" Tommy asked. "Sure!" Lily said happily. They played with their toys and talked about what they wanted to do when they grew up.
Suddenly, they heard Lily's mommy call them for lunch. "Come on, kids! The soup is ready!" she said. They ran to the kitchen and saw the delicious soup on the table. "Yummy!" they both said. They ate the soup and talked about their plans for the world to come. It was a fun day for Lily and Tommy.
