Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a brown puppy named Max. One day, Lily and Max went to the park to play. They saw some other kids playing with a hoop. Lily wanted to play too, but she didn't have a hoop. 
Max saw that Lily was sad, so he went to the other kids and asked if they could share their hoop with Lily. The kids said yes and gave Lily a hoop. Lily was so happy! She played with Max and the other kids all day. 
At the end of the day, Lily went home and told her mommy and daddy about all the fun she had at the park. Max was happy too, because he got to play with the hoop and make new friends. From that day on, Lily and Max went to the park every day to play with their hoop and make new friends.
