Once upon a time, there was a busy bee named Benny. Benny loved to fly around and collect nectar from flowers. One day, Benny saw a bird perched on a tree branch. Benny wanted to say hello, so he flew closer.
Suddenly, the bird flew towards Benny and knocked him off the branch! Benny dropped his honeycomb and it spilled all over the ground. Benny was sad because he worked hard to collect his honey. But then, the bird did something unexpected. He flew down and started to help Benny pick up the honeycomb.
After they finished, the bird gave Benny a journal to write in. Benny was surprised and happy. He never expected a bird to be so kind. From that day on, Benny and the bird became good friends and they always helped each other out.
