Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to talk. She talked all day long and never stopped. One day, her mommy took her to a museum. Lily saw lots of pretty things and talked about them.
Then, she saw a big painting with lots of colors. She asked her mommy if she could paint like that too. Her mommy said that she could, but Lily had to be patient and practice.
Lily practiced every day and became very patient. She sang and talked while she got better. One day, she got a microphone and sang a song in front of everyone at the museum. They all clapped and cheered for her. Lily was so happy that she talked about it all the time.
