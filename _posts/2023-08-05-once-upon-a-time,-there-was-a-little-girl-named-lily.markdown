Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she was playing outside in the park when she saw a lost puppy. The puppy looked very lonely and sad.
Lily went up to the puppy and said, "Hi there, little puppy. Are you lost?" The puppy barked and wagged its tail, and Lily knew that the puppy needed help.
Lily asked around the park if anyone was missing a puppy, but no one was. So, Lily decided to take the puppy home with her. She was very happy to have a new friend to play with.
From that day on, Lily and the puppy were inseparable. They played together every day and the puppy was never lonely again. Lily was very happy that she could help the puppy find a new home with her.
