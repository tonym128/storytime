Once upon a time, there was a big building. It was so tall that it touched the sky. A little girl named Lily lived near the building. She loved to play with her ball near it. One day, she threw her ball too hard and it hit the building. The building started to shake and then it fell down. It was broken!
Lily was scared and she ran to her mom. "Mommy, the building broke!" she said. "It's okay, Lily. We will fix it," her mom replied. "But first, let's reverse what happened. We need to call someone to help us." 
They called a man who came and fixed the broken building. Lily learned that it's important to be careful when playing near big buildings. And she was happy that everyone in the town was safe again.
