One day, a rich man sat in his big chair. He ate a big waffle. It was very yummy. He wanted to share it with his friends. So, he called his friends and said, "Come to my house. I have a big waffle to share."
His friends came to his house. They sat in chairs and ate the waffle together. They were very happy. But then, something unexpected happened. A little bird flew into the house. The bird landed on the big chair.
The little bird looked at the waffle and said, "Can I have some waffle too?" The rich man and his friends were surprised. They did not know that birds could talk. But they shared their waffle with the little bird.
The bird ate the waffle very fast. It was so full that the bird started to weep. The rich man and his friends felt sad for the bird. They wanted to make it feel better.
In the end, the rich man and his friends gave the bird more waffle. The bird stopped weeping and became very happy. They all became good friends and ate waffles together every day.
