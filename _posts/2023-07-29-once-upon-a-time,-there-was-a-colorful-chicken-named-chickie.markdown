Once upon a time, there was a colorful chicken named Chickie. Chickie lived on a farm with other animals. One day, Chickie met a mule named Molly. Molly was big and had long ears.
"Hello, Chickie!" said Molly. "Welcome to our farm!"
"Thank you, Molly!" said Chickie. "I like your colorful tails!"
Suddenly, a big storm came and the wind blew all the leaves off the trees. Chickie got scared and hid under a pile of hay.
Molly saw Chickie hiding and said, "Don't be afraid, Chickie. I'll help you feel better."
Molly used her long ears to lift up the hay and helped Chickie feel safe. Chickie felt happy and grateful to have a new friend like Molly.
