Once upon a time, a big whale lived in the deep blue sea. The whale had many friends, like fish, turtles, and seagulls. They all liked to play games and swim together. The whale was very alert and always watched where he was going.
One day, the whale met a little boy on the beach. The boy was sad because he lost his toy. The whale wanted to help the boy, so he asked his fish and turtles to look for the toy. The fish and turtles said, "Yes, we will help you!"
The fish and turtles went to search for the toy. They looked under rocks, in the sand, and behind the waves. Finally, the turtle found the toy near the water. The turtle brought the toy back to the boy. The boy was so happy that he gave the whale a big hug. The whale felt good because he helped the boy gain a new friend. From that day on, the boy and the whale were best friends, and they played together every day.
