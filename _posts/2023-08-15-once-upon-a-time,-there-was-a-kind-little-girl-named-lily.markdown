Once upon a time, there was a kind little girl named Lily. She lived in a small village with her mom and dad. One day, Lily went for a walk in the forest. She saw a big log on the ground and decided to climb on it. 
Suddenly, she heard a voice. "Hello there!" said a little mouse. "What are you doing here?" 
"I'm just exploring," said Lily. "What are you doing?" 
"I'm studying," said the mouse. "I'm learning about the forest and all the animals that live here." 
Lily was amazed. She had never seen a mouse study before. "That's so cool!" she said. "Can I study too?" 
The mouse smiled. "Of course you can! We can study together and learn about the forest and all the creatures that live here." And so, Lily and the mouse spent the rest of the day studying and having fun.
