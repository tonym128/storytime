Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue loved to sing. She sang all day long. One day, a big, loud bus came down the road. The bus was very harsh and made Sue scared. She did not want to sing anymore.
Sue's friend, Tom, saw her sad face. Tom asked, "Why are you sad, Sue?" Sue said, "The big, loud bus scared me. I don't want to sing." Tom smiled and said, "Don't worry, Sue. I will sing with you."
Sue and Tom stood in front of the bus. They sang a beautiful song together. The bus driver heard their song and smiled. The bus driver was not harsh with Sue anymore. He drove them safely to their homes.
Sue and Tom learned that when we share happy moments, they become stronger. They became the best of friends and always sang together. And everyone loved to hear their happy songs.
