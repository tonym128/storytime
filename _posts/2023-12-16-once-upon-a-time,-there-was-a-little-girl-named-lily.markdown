Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play dress-up and wear different costumes. One day, she put on her princess costume and went to show her mommy.
"Look, mommy! I'm a princess!" Lily said.
"You look beautiful, my little princess," mommy replied.
Lily went outside to play with her friends. She saw her friend Timmy playing with a ball.
"Can I play too?" Lily asked.
"Sure, but be careful," Timmy warned.
Lily was careless and threw the ball too hard. It hit a tree and popped. They couldn't use the ball anymore.
"I'm sorry, Timmy. I'll get you a new ball," Lily said.
"It's okay, Lily. You can help me find one in my toy box," Timmy said.
Lily was happy to help her friend and they went to Timmy's toy box to find a new ball. From then on, Lily was more careful when she played with her friends.
