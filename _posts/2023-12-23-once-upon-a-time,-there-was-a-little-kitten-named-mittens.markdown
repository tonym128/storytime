Once upon a time, there was a little kitten named Mittens. Mittens was very naughty and liked to play pranks on her owner, Sarah. One day, Mittens saw a mouse in the closet and tried to catch it. But the mouse was too quick and ran away.
Sarah saw what Mittens had done and said, "Mittens, you acted like a bad kitten. You scared the mouse!"
Mittens felt sad and didn't know what to do. But then, Sarah said, "Don't worry, Mittens. I'll give you a treat if you promise to be a good kitten from now on."
Mittens was happy and promised to be good. From that day on, Mittens never acted like a naughty kitten again and always remembered to be kind to her owner.
