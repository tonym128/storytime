Once upon a time, in a small village, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a fun idea to play on the swings. He loved to swing high in the sky, but his mom always told him to be careful.
One day, when Tim was swinging, he saw a big ball stuck in a tree. He wanted to get the ball down, but the tree was very tall. Tim was scared, but he had a brave face. He knew he could do it if he tried. So, he just let a little push on the swing, and the ball started to fall.
As the ball fell, Tim's mom saw what happened and ran over to help him. She looked up at the tree and saw the big ball stuck in its branches. She reached up and got the ball down for Tim. He was so happy and thanked his mom. From that day on, Tim always remembered to be careful when he played on the swings.
