Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and climb trees. One day, she discovered a big tree with lots of branches. She climbed all the way to the top and looked out at the charming world around her.
As she sat in the tree, she noticed a bird's nest with little eggs inside. She watched as the mother bird came back and gave her babies to take care of. Lily realized how important it was to be kind to all living things, big or small.
From that day on, Lily made sure to always be kind to others and nature. She felt happy knowing that she could make a difference in the world around her anytime she wanted.
