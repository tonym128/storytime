Once upon a time, there was a big, big castle. It had a huge chamber with lots of rooms. In one of the rooms, there was a little princess.
The princess had a toy horse that she loved to ride. She would ride it all around the castle's garden. One day, a naughty dragon came to the castle and tried to steal the princess's toy horse.
The princess was very brave and rode her horse to the dragon's cave. She saw the dragon sleeping and quickly took her toy horse back to her chamber. Her toys were safe and sound, and she was very happy.
