Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to eat yummy food. One day, his mom gave him a cookie. Timmy took a bite and said, "Mmm, this cookie is so yummy!"
His mom asked, "Do you want another one?"
Timmy replied, "No, I want to whistle instead."
His mom was surprised and said, "Okay, whistle for me."
Timmy then whistled a happy tune and his mom smiled. She said, "I love your whistle, Timmy. It sounds so peaceful."
Timmy finished his cookie and went outside to play. He felt happy and peaceful too, just like when he ate his yummy cookie.
