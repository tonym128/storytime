Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and look for pretty things. One day, she saw a butterfly flying in the sky. It was so beautiful and colorful. She wanted to catch it, so she ran after it.
As she was running, she saw her mom calling her for lunch. She was so hungry that she forgot about the butterfly and went inside. Her mom had made her favorite sandwich, but when she took a bite, she noticed that it was spoiled. She didn't like it at all.
Lily went back outside and saw the beautiful butterfly again. She wanted to catch it, but it flew away. She felt sad and disappointed. She realized that she should have eaten her lunch instead of chasing after the butterfly. From that day on, she always remembered to eat her lunch and not chase after things that were too pretty to catch.
