Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and write stories. One day, she showed her drawings to her mom and said, "Look mommy, I drew a picture of a unicorn!" Her mom smiled and said, "Wow, Lily, you are so talented!"
Lily was eager to show her dad her drawings. She ran to her dad and said, "Daddy, look at my unicorn drawing! Do you like it?" Her dad smiled and said, "I love it, Lily. You are so creative!"
Lily was so happy that her dad loved her drawings. She decided to write a story about her unicorn. She wrote, "Once upon a time, there was a unicorn that could talk. He had a horn on his head that made him very special. One day, he met a little girl who was lost in the forest." Her mom and dad loved hearing about her story and told her how proud they were of her.
From that day on, Lily continued to write stories and draw pictures. She loved sharing her art with her family and friends.
