Once upon a time, there was a big red car. The car had a horn that looked very funny. Every time the car drove by, the horn would make a silly noise. 
One day, the car went for a drive in the countryside. It saw a field of green grass and decided to stop. The car got out and walked on the grass. It felt very soft and flexible. The car liked the feeling of being on the grass. 
After a while, the car got back in the car and drove home. It honked its horn one more time before driving away. The car had a fun day driving and playing on the grass.
