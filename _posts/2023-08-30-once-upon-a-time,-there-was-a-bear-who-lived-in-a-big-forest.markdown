Once upon a time, there was a bear who lived in a big forest. The bear was very wild and he loved to play with his friends. One day, the bear decided to display his favorite toy to all his friends in the forest. He ran to the river and showed his toy to the fish. The fish thought it was very cool! Then, the bear showed his toy to the birds and the rabbits. They all thought it was amazing! The bear was happy that his friends liked his toy and he felt proud that he could display it. From that day on, the bear loved to show his toys to his friends in the forest.
