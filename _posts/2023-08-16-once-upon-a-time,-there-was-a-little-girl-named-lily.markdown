Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park. One day, she saw a lovely red bow on the ground. She picked it up and put it in her hair. It looked so pretty!
As Lily was walking around the park, she saw a little boy crying. She went over to him and asked him what was wrong. He said he lost his favorite toy. Lily knew how sad it felt to lose something special, so she decided to help him look for it.
They searched and searched, but they couldn't find the toy. Suddenly, Lily remembered the lovely bow in her hair. She took it out and waved it in the air. The little boy's eyes got big and he stopped crying. "That's my toy!" he exclaimed. They ran to where the toy was and found it. The little boy was so happy and grateful. Lily learned that helping others can make them happy and that sometimes, a little kindness can go a long way.
