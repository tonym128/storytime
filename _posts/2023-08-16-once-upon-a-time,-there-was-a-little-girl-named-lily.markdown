Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and color pictures. One day, she drew a picture of a big yellow sun in the sky. 
Her mom came in and said, "Wow, Lily! That's such a beautiful picture. You are so talented!"
Lily smiled and said, "Thank you, Mommy. I want to print it out and put it on my wall."
Her mom said, "Sure, we can print it out and hang it up. First, we need to fold the paper in half."
Lily helped her mom fold the paper and they printed it out with the printer. Then, they put it on the wall and it looked so pretty. Lily felt calm and happy looking at her picture every day.
