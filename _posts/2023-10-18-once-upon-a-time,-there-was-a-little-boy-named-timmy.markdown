Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and explore the woods behind his house. One day, Timmy found a treasure map! He was so excited and couldn't wait to find the treasure. 
Timmy followed the map and found the treasure chest. But when he opened it, he saw that the treasure was fake! He was so disappointed and didn't know what to do. 
Suddenly, Timmy had an idea. He decided to release the fake treasure into the woods. He knew that the real treasure was the adventure he had while searching for it. Timmy felt happy again and went on his own adventure in the woods.
