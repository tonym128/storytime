Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved chocolate more than anything in the world. One day, Lily's friend came over to play. Her friend was very thoughtful and brought some chocolate for Lily to eat. Lily was so happy and said, "Thank you for the chocolate, it looks so yummy!" 
Lily's friend said, "I have a surprise for you. I brought my favorite toy, a teddy bear. Do you want to play with it?" Lily replied, "Yes, please!" They played with the teddy bear for a while, but then Lily started to feel sick. She said to her friend, "I don't feel good. My tummy hurts." Her friend said, "Maybe you just ate too much chocolate. Let's go lie down and rest." 
Lily and her friend went to lie down and rest. After a while, Lily felt better and said, "Thank you for being such a thoughtful friend. I feel much better now." Her friend smiled and said, "You're welcome. I'm glad you're feeling better." Lily
