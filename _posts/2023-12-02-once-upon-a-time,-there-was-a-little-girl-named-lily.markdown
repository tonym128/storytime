Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pink dress that she loved to wear every day. One day, she found a shiny penny on the ground. She picked it up and put it in her pocket. 
As she walked home, she saw a bird sitting on a tree branch. She blinked her eyes and looked up. The bird was singing a beautiful song. Lily wanted to sing with the bird, but her voice was too small. 
When she got home, she took the penny out of her pocket and put it on her nightstand. She closed her eyes and tried to sing like the bird. Even though her voice was tiny, her heart felt happy. She fell asleep, dreaming of all the things she could do with her pink penny.
