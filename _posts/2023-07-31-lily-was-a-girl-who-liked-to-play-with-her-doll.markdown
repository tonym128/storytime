Lily was a girl who liked to play with her doll. She gave her doll a name, Anna, and a dress, pink. Lily and Anna did everything together. They had tea parties, read books, and sang songs. Lily loved Anna very much.
One day, Lily's mom said, "Lily, we are going to visit grandma. She has a big house and a garden. Do you want to go?" Lily nodded. She liked grandma. She had a cat, a dog, and a bird. Lily wanted to bring Anna. She asked her mom, "Can I bring Anna, please?"
Mom smiled. "Yes, you can, Lily. Anna can come too. But you have to be careful. Anna is fragile. She has a lot of style. She likes to wear different clothes and hats. If you squeeze her too hard, her dress will tear. If you squeeze her too hard, she might get a hole or a stain."
Lily agreed. She put Anna on her bed and gave her a hug. "Don't be scared, Anna. I won't squeeen more people with their new magic wand. And they lived happily ever after.
