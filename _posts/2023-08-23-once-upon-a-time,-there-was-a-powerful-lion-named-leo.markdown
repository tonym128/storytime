Once upon a time, there was a powerful lion named Leo. Leo had a big, soft sweater. He loved to wear it every day. One day, Leo met a little bunny named Ben. Ben saw the sweater and thought it was nice.
"Can I borrow your sweater?" asked Ben. Leo said, "Yes, you can borrow my sweater." Ben was very happy. He put on the sweater and it made him feel warm and cozy.
Later, they found a big tree with lots of yummy fruit. Leo used his powerful paws to get the fruit. Ben and Leo sat under the tree, eating the fruit together. They became best friends and shared the sweater when they needed it.
