Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She twisted a balloon into a shape that looked like a flower. She was so happy and showed it to her mom. Her mom said it was beautiful and put it on the fridge.
One day, Lily woke up and saw the sun shining bright. She felt happy and wanted to play outside. She ran to the park and saw a boy playing with a shiny red ball. She wanted to play with it too, but the boy didn't want to share. Lily felt sad and went back home.
When she got home, she saw her balloon on the table. But something was different. It wasn't peaceful anymore. It was dark and scary. She picked it up and heard a loud noise. Suddenly, the balloon exploded and scared her. She started crying and her mom came to comfort her. From that day on, Lily learned to share her toys and be careful with things that twist and change.
