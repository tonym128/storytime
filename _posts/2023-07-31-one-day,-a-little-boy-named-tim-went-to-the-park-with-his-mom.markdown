One day, a little boy named Tim went to the park with his mom. At the park, he saw a big pond. Tim liked to play in the pond, so he asked his mom, "Can I play in the pond, please?" His mom said, "Yes, but be careful not to step in the water."
Tim ran to the pond and saw a frog. The frog was green and slimy. Tim thought the frog looked disgusting, but he wanted to talk to the frog. He said, "Hello, Mr. Frog. Why do you look so disgusting?" The frog said, "I don't like to be dirty. I like to be clean and pretty."
Tim wanted to help the frog. He took his hands and started to wash the frog. As he washed the frog, something unexpected happened. The frog turned into a beautiful butterfly! The butterfly said, "Thank you, Tim! You made me clean and pretty again. Now, I will help you." The butterfly helped Tim climb the slide, and he had so much fun. In the end, Tim made a new friend, and they played together at the park all day.
