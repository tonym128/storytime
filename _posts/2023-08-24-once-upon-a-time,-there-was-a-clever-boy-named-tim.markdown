Once upon a time, there was a clever boy named Tim. Tim loved to play with his toy violin. He played it every day and made happy songs.
One day, Tim saw a big tree with a bird's nest. He wanted to see the baby birds, so he climbed the tree. But, oh no! He was not careful and he started to fall.
Tim held his violin tight and closed his eyes. As he fell, his violin opened up like a big umbrella. Tim landed on the soft grass. The baby birds were safe and happy. Tim was a hero!
