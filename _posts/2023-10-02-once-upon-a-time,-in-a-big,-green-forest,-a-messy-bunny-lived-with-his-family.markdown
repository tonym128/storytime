Once upon a time, in a big, green forest, a messy bunny lived with his family. The bunny loved to play all day, but he never cleaned up. His mom and dad always urge him to help, but the bunny just wanted to have fun.
One sunny day, the messy bunny saw a big, red apple on the ground. He wanted to eat it, but it was too big to carry. He tried and tried, but it wouldn't move an inch. The bunny was sad and wondered how he could get the apple.
Then, a strong wind blew through the forest. The wind picked up the dirty bunny and the big, red apple, and carried them far away. The messy bunny realized that he should have listened to his mom and dad. He learned his lesson and promised to clean up after himself from now on.
