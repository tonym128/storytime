Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. She was very excited because she was going to the store with her mom to buy a toy. Sue could not wait to get there and pick out the best toy.
When they got to the store, Sue saw a toy puppy that she wanted. But her mom told her it was a fake puppy, not a real one. Sue was sad but then she saw a bright red ball. She picked it up and it made her happy again.
Sue and her mom bought the red ball and went home. Sue played with her new ball all day. She loved her new ball and was very happy that she got to go to the store with her mom.
