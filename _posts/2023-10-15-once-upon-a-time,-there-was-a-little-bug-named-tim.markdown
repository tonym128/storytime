Once upon a time, there was a little bug named Tim. Tim loved to crawl on the ground and look for food. One day, Tim found some money on the ground. He was very happy and wanted to keep it.
Tim showed the money to his friend, Sam. Sam was a tiny bug too. Sam said, "That money is not yours, Tim. It is bad to take things that are not yours." Tim did not listen to Sam. He wanted to keep the money for himself.
As Tim crawled away with the money, something unexpected happened. A big bird swooped down and took the money from Tim. The bird flew away with the money and Tim was very sad. He wished he had listened to Sam. The bird had tricked Tim into taking the bad money. Tim learned a lesson that day, but he still had a bad ending because he did not listen to his friend.
