Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside with his friends. One day, Timmy's friend Billy saw a toy car that he really wanted. Billy was envious of Timmy's toy car and asked if he could play with it. Timmy said yes and gave Billy the toy car to play with. 
As they were playing, Timmy observed something strange. He saw a bird flying in the sky with a mark on its wing. Timmy told Billy about the mark on the bird's wing and Billy wanted to see it too. They both watched the bird fly away and wondered what it was looking at. 
After a while, it was time for Timmy to go home. He said goodbye to Billy and started walking home. On his way, Timmy observed a butterfly flying in the flowers. He thought it was very pretty and followed it for a little while before continuing on his way home. When he got home, he told his mom about the mark on the bird's wing and the butterfly he saw. His mom was happy to hear about his adventures and gave him a big hug.
