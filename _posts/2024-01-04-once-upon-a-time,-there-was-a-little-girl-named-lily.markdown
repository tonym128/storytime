Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she found a pole in her backyard. It was long and brown and very tall. She decided to play with it and pretend it was a sword.
Lily's mom came outside and saw her playing with the pole. "That's an expensive pole," she said. "We have to be careful with it." Lily didn't understand what "expensive" meant, but she knew it sounded bad.
Suddenly, the pole started to shake and wobble. Lily's mom quickly grabbed her and pulled her away. They both looked at the pole and saw that it was leaning over and about to fall over. They quickly ran inside and called the park workers to come and fix it.
After the pole was fixed, Lily's mom said "I'm glad we were safe. Let's go inside and have some ice cream." Lily smiled and followed her mom inside, happy to be safe and sound.
