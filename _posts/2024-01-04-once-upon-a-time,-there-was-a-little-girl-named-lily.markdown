Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily's mommy told her she was going to have a tutor. Lily didn't know what a tutor was, but her mommy explained that it was someone who helps her learn.
The next day, a kind lady came to Lily's house to teach her. The lady had bright blue hair and wore a big smile on her face. Lily liked her right away. The lady showed Lily how to count and read signs, and soon Lily was able to say her ABCs all by herself.
Before leaving, the lady reminded Lily to wash her hands before dinner. Lily ran to the bathroom and washed her hands with soap and water. She felt proud that she knew how to wash her hands like a big girl. And she also felt happy because she had a new friend who taught her new things.
