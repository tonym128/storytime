Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play outside. One day, she went to the park and saw a big pine tree. She wanted to climb it, but she was too small. Suddenly, she saw a squirrel who climbed the tree with ease. 
Lily followed the squirrel and found a secret path behind the pine tree. She walked down the path and found a big box. She tried to open it, but it was locked. She searched for a key and found it hidden under a rock. 
Lily used the key to open the box and was surprised to find a famous toy inside. She was so happy and played with it all day. She thanked the squirrel for showing her the secret path and went home with her new famous toy.
