Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to pretend that she was a princess and would wear a big, sparkly crown on her head. One day, she decided to go on an adventure in the forest near her house. 
As she walked through the trees, she saw a group of animals having a race. One of the animals was a fast rabbit, and the others were slow and competitive. Lily wanted to join in on the fun, so she asked if she could race too. 
The rabbit said yes, and they started to run. Lily was not the fastest, but she pretended that she was the fastest runner in the forest. She ran as fast as she could and even though she did not win, she had a great time pretending to be a brave racer. 
When she got back home, she told her mom all about her adventure in the forest. Her mom was so proud of her for using her imagination and having fun. From that day on, Lily loved to pretend and use her imagination to go on exciting adventures.
