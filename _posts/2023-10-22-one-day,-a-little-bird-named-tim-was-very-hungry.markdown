One day, a little bird named Tim was very hungry. He saw a worm on the ground. Tim wanted to eat the worm, but he got stuck in a net. He felt helpless. He tried to fly away, but he could not.
A kind boy named Sam saw Tim. He wanted to help. Sam said, "Don't worry, little bird. I will save you!" Sam carefully took the trap off Tim. Tim was free and happy.
"Thank you for saving me, Sam!" said Tim. Sam smiled and said, "You're welcome, Tim. Always help others when they need it." Tim and Sam became good friends, and they played together every day. The moral of the story is to always help others when they need it.
