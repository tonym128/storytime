Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a cute puppy named Max. One day, Lily took Max for a walk in the park. Max was so excited to go outside and play. 
When they got to the park, Lily saw a big wheel that could whirl round and round. She asked Max if he wanted to go on it with her. Max barked happily and wagged his tail. 
Lily put Max on the wheel and they started to spin around and around. It was so much fun! When they got off, Max was a little dizzy and smelly. Lily said, "Max, you need a bath!" Max replied, "Woof woof, okay!" 
Lily and Max went back home and Max took a nice bath. Lily snuggled up with Max and said, "Goodnight, Max. You are my best friend." Max wagged his tail and licked Lily's face. They both fell asleep, happy and tired from their fun day at the park.
