Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sun. One day, she saw her friend Billy walking by. She said, "Hi Billy, do you want to come play with me?"
Billy said, "Yes, I would love to play with you Lily." 
Lily invited Billy to play with her in her garden. They played with their toys and ran around in the grass. After a while, Billy saw a butterfly and tried to catch it. But the butterfly flew away too fast.
Lily said, "Don't worry Billy, the spirit of the butterfly will come back." 
Billy smiled and said, "That's right Lily, I hope so." 
As they played, the weather started to get harsh and cold. Lily said, "It's getting cold in here. Let's go inside and have some hot chocolate." 
They went inside and had some hot chocolate together. They were happy to have each other as friends and wondered what other fun things they could do together.
