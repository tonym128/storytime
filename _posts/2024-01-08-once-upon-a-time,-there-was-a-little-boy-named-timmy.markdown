Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy aeroplane. He would fly it around the house and make airplane noises.
One day, Timmy's mom called him for lunch. Timmy was so hungry that he forgot to put his aeroplane away. His mom scolded him and said, "You must always put your toys away, or they might get lost."
Timmy felt bad and promised to be more careful. But the next day, he forgot again. This time, he was playing with his avocado toy instead. He tossed it up in the air and it landed on the floor with a big crash. Timmy's mom was very angry and said, "I told you to put your toys away! Now your avocado is all broken and crazy looking."
Timmy felt even worse than before. He learned that it's important to listen to his mom and take care of his toys. From that day on, he always put his toys away when he was done playing with them.
