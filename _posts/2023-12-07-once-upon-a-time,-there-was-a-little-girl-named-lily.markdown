Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys all day long. One day, she found a pretty ornament in the garden. It was shiny and sparkly, and it made her very happy.
Lily showed the ornament to her mom and said, "Look, Mommy! This is so pretty!" Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, it is. Be careful not to drop it."
Lily played with the ornament all day long, but she didn't forget to be careful. She put it on a shelf, next to her other toys. Every time she looked at it, she felt happy. And every night, she went to bed dreaming of all the fun she would have with her new ornament.
