Once upon a time there was an old guard. Every day he would hold a big, heavy rock. He would look around and make sure everyone was safe.
One day the guard was feeling very tired and he wanted to sit down. He looked around and saw a very old tree. He went over to the tree and sat down underneath it.
The guard felt better and he smiled. He looked up and saw something very unusual - a little bird was flying by! The bird had bright blue feathers and was singing a sweet song.
The guard heard the bird singing and it made him feel happy. He stayed under the tree and watched the bird, holding the old rock tight. He enjoyed the sunshine and the sound of the birdâ€™s song all day. 
The old guard knew he could always come back to the tree when he needed to rest. And he was so happy to have found such a special place.
