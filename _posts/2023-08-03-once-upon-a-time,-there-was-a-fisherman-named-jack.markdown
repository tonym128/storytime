Once upon a time, there was a fisherman named Jack. He loved to fish in the river every day. One day, Jack caught a big fish. He was so happy that he shouted, "Wow, this is a big fish!"
Suddenly, the fisherman's face became pale. He realized that he had forgotten to put the hook on the fish's mouth. "Oh no!" he said. "I forgot to put the hook on the fish's mouth."
Just then, a little girl walked by and saw Jack's problem. "Don't worry, Mr. Fisherman," she said. "I can help you." She took the fish and put the hook on its mouth. The fish was so hungry that it ate all the other fish in the river.
Jack was so grateful to the little girl. "Thank you so much for helping me," he said. "You are so kind." From that day on, Jack always made sure to put the hook on the fish's mouth before he went fishing.
