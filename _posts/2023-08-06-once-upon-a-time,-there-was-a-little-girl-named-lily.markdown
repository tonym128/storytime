Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to look up at the big round moon in the sky at night. She would stare at it with her eyes and imagine what it would be like to touch it. 
One night, Lily's mom gave her a sweet candle to keep near her bedside. Lily loved how the candle smelled and how it made her room feel cozy. She would stay up late, looking at the moon and the stars while she ate her sweet candle. 
As she lay in bed, Lily noticed that she was feeling lonely. She talked to the moon and the stars and asked them to stay with her all night long. Eventually, she fell asleep with a smile on her face, knowing that she had friends under the big round moon.
