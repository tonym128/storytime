Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to bounce on her pink bed, but her mom did not give her a chair to sit on. Lily was frustrated because she wanted to bounce on the bed, but she didn't want to sit on the floor.
One day, Lily's mom took her to the store and they bought a big pink couch for her room. Lily was so happy! She bounced on the couch and it was so much fun. She could bounce on the couch and it was like jumping on a trampoline.
But then, Lily's mom had to go to work and Lily was sad. She wanted to keep bouncing on the couch. So, she put the couch back in its place and sat on the floor. She bounced on the couch and it felt so good. Lily was happy again and she forgot all about being frustrated.
