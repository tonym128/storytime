Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She had a pale face and loved playing with her dolls. One day, Lily's mom asked her to help sort the clothes. Lily happily agreed and started sorting the clothes into piles.
As she was sorting, Lily found a button that she had never seen before. She picked up the button and showed it to her mom. "Look, Mommy! A pretty button!" Lily exclaimed.
Her mom smiled and said, "That's a nice button, Lily. Do you want to keep it?"
Lily nodded excitedly and put the button in her pocket. From that day on, Lily always kept the button with her whenever she sorted the clothes. She felt very proud of herself for being such a good helper.
