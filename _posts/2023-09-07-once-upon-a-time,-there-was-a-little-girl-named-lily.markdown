Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, but her favorite toy was her chicken toy. One day, Lily's mom told her it was time to bathe. Lily didn't want to stop playing with her chicken, but her mom said it was important to stay clean.
Lily went to the bathroom and her mom helped her get in the tub. She pretended to be a mermaid and splashed around. After her bath, Lily's mom wrapped her in a warm towel and dried her off. Lily felt so clean and cozy.
Later that day, Lily's dad came home from work. He had a harsh tone when he saw Lily's clean face. But Lily didn't mind because she knew it was time to play with her chicken toy again. She hugged it tightly and played with it until it was time for bed.
