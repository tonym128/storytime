Once there was a little bird. He was grey and had yellow wings. He could fly high in the sky.
One day, he was hungry and decided to look for food. He spotted a big, tall tree. He flew up and perched on a branch. He pecked at the apple until it was all gone.
He flew down and saw a big sight. The sun was setting and the sky was pretty pink. It was so rare to see such a sight from so high in the sky.
He saw a tall mountain and decided to fly down and explore it. He saw a lake and lots of other things. Some were he'd never seen before. 
The little bird was so happy to have found such a rare sight. He decided to stay there forever and fly around the lake. And that's what he did.
