Once upon a time, there was a brave princess. She was on a mission to save her kingdom from a mean dragon. She rode on her horse and eventually arrived at the dragon's cave. 
The dragon was very angry when he saw the princess. He breathed fire and growled, but the princess stayed brave and stayed calm. She bravely asked the dragon to start a fight. The dragon was surprised by her bravery and he agreed to fight. 
The princess used all her strength to beat the dragon. After a long battle, the dragon was so tired that he fell asleep. The princess quickly took the dragon away to the kingdom. Everyone cheered for the brave princess and her victory. The kingdom was safe once again. 
The end.
