One day, a goose named Gigi went to the park. Gigi was a spoiled goose who always wanted more toys. She saw an old man sitting on a bench with a toy.
Gigi went to the old man and said, "Give me your toy, please." The old man looked at Gigi and said, "No, Gigi. This toy is mine."
Gigi was sad and asked again, "Please, can I have your toy?" The old man shook his head and said, "No, Gigi. You have many toys at home. You do not need another one."
Gigi thought about it and realized the old man was right. She went back home and played with her toys. From that day on, Gigi learned to be happy with what she had and not be a spoiled goose.
