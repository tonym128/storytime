Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore the world around her. One day, she found a pretty butterfly and followed it into the forest.
As she walked deeper into the forest, she met a friendly squirrel who asked her what she was doing. "I'm looking for the spirit of the forest," Lily said with a smile.
The squirrel replied, "The spirit of the forest is hidden behind those trees. But be careful, there's a disgusting smell coming from a skunk."
Lily nodded and continued on her adventure, excited to find the spirit of the forest. Eventually, she found the skunk and quickly ran away. She was scared but happy to have seen the spirit of the forest.
