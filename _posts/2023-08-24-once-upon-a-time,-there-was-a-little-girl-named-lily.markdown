Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she saw a clumsy caterpillar crawling on the ground. It was very thin and delicate.
Lily promised to take care of the caterpillar and give it a safe place to live. She made a cozy home out of leaves and made sure there were lots of plants around it. Every day, she visited the caterpillar and watched it grow bigger and bigger.
One morning, Lily woke up to find that the caterpillar had turned into a beautiful butterfly! It flapped its wings and flew away, leaving Lily in amazement. She knew that her promise to take care of the caterpillar had come true and she felt very proud of herself.
