Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the park with her friends. One day, while playing, she saw a big, yellow lemon tree. She wanted to pick a lemon, but she didn't know how to reach it.
Then, she had an idea. She found a big rock and put it under the tree. She stood on the rock and reached up to grab a lemon. But instead of a lemon, she found a beautiful butterfly. It flew away, and Lily was surprised.
Lily learned that sometimes things are not what they seem, and it's important to keep looking for the good things that reveal themselves. She also realized that sometimes, unexpected things can happen when you least expect it.
