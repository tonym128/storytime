Once upon a time, there was a friendly little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and watch the birds fly in the sky. One day, she saw a pigeon sitting on a tree branch. She wanted to get closer to the pigeon, but it flew away. 
Lily was sad that she couldn't get closer to the pigeon. She decided to try again the next day. The next morning, she woke up early and went outside to look for the pigeon. She saw it sitting on the same branch as yesterday. 
Lily slowly slowly walked towards the pigeon and tried to get close. Suddenly, the pigeon flew away again! Lily was sad once more, but she knew she would see the pigeon again someday. From that day on, Lily always looked for the friendly pigeon when she went outside to play.
