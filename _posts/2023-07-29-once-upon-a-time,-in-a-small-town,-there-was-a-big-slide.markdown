Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a big slide. All the kids loved to play on the slide. One day, a new boy came to the town. He wanted to play on the slide too, but he was scared. He thought he would not be successful at it.
The new boy's friend, a girl named Sue, saw that he was scared. She said, "Don't worry, I will help you!" So, Sue and the new boy went to the slide together. They climbed up and sat down. They held hands with their hands, and they slid down the slide. They laughed and had fun.
But then, another boy, named Jim, came and said, "I want to play too!" This made Sue sad. Sue told Jim, "It's okay, we can all play together!" So, Sue, Spin the new boy, and Jim all played on the slide. They were all happy and successful in having fun.
