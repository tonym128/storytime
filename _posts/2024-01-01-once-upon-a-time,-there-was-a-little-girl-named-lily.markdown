Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the park and feed the birds. One day, she saw an ostrich walking around. "Hello, ostrich! Do you want some food?" asked Lily. The ostrich replied, "Yes, please. I am very hungry."
Lily went to the store and bought some delicious bread. She brought it back to the park and gave it to the ostrich. The ostrich ate it all up and said, "Thank you, Lily. That was very delicious." Lily smiled and said, "You're welcome, ostrich. I'm happy to help you."
From that day on, the ostrich and Lily became good friends. They would play together in the park and find delicious food to share. Lily was happy to have a new friend and the ostrich was happy to have someone to play with. They both knew that they would always be there for each other.
