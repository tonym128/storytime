Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the garden. One day, she found a beautiful flower with deep colors. She picked it up and showed it to her mom. 
"Mommy, look at this pretty flower I found!" Lily said.
"That's lovely, Lily. You can hold it and take care of it," her mom replied.
Lily held the flower in her hand and continued to play. Later that day, she saw a bird with a broken wing. She remembered the flower and how she held it close. She thought about the bird and how important it was to be kind to animals. 
So, she gently held the bird in her hands and brought it to her mom. Her mom helped the bird and soon it was able to fly again. Lily felt happy knowing that she helped the bird. She learned that holding something gently and kind to others is important.
