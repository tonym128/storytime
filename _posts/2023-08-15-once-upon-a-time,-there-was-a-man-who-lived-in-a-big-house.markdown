Once upon a time, there was a man who lived in a big house. He loved to play with his dog and run around in the yard. One day, he found a puzzle on the ground. It was very hard, but he was determined to solve it.
He tried and tried, but he couldn't figure out how to put the pieces together. He felt frustrated and angry with himself. He decided to rest and think about it. While he was resting, the dog came over and started playing with the puzzle pieces.
The man watched as the dog solved the puzzle and put the pieces together. He was so happy and proud of his dog. But then, the dog accidentally knocked over the puzzle and it broke into many pieces. The man was devastated and cried.
He realized that sometimes things don't go the way we want them to. He hugged his dog and thanked him for trying to help. Even though he was sad, he knew that he still had his best friend.
