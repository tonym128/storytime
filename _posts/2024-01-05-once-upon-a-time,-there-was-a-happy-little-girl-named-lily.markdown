Once upon a time, there was a happy little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and run around outside. One day, she went to visit her grandma. Grandma had a big body and always looked healthy.
Lily asked, "Grandma, why do you look so healthy?"
Grandma replied, "I eat healthy food and exercise every day."
Lily didn't understand what "healthy" meant, so she asked, "What does healthy mean?"
Grandma explained, "Healthy means that food helps your body grow strong and happy."
Lily realized that she needed to eat healthy food to grow strong and happy too. She thanked her grandma for teaching her something new and promised to eat more healthy food. From that day on, Lily made sure to eat lots of fruits and vegetables to stay healthy and strong like her grandma.
