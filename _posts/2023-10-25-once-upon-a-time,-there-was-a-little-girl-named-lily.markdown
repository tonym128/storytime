Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she found a shiny axe in the garden. 
"Wow, this is so cool!" said Lily.
Her mom came outside and saw the axe. "Lily, that is dangerous. You should not play with it," said her mom.
"But it's so shiny and pretty," said Lily.
Her mom explained that it was not safe and they should put it back in the shed. Lily agreed and they found a tree to hang the axe on. 
From that day on, Lily always remembered to be careful and not play with dangerous things.
