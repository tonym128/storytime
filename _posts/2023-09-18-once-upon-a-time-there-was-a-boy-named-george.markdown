Once upon a time there was a boy named George. He was so excited for his first day of school and all the nice things he would get to do. 
When he arrived home, George was feeling a bit nervous. He didn't know anyone or anything to be petted or played with. 
His mum noticed and came over to him. She said, "Don't worry, George. I'm here to comfort you." She gave him a big hug and said that everything was going to be easy. 
George felt a bit better and smiled. He knew he wasn't alone and that his mum was always there to make him feel better. Together they went off to school the next day.
