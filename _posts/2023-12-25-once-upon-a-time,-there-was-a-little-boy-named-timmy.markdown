Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to sing and dance, but he was very quiet. He didn't like to make noise, so he never sang or danced very loud. One day, Timmy's mom bought him a microphone. It was big and red, and it made Timmy very happy.
Timmy wanted to sing into his microphone, but he didn't know how to use it. He asked his mom for help, and she showed him how to use it. Timmy had so much fun singing into his microphone that he sang all day long. His mom was proud of him for being so creative.
As Timmy grew older, he learned to be less noisy. He still sang and danced, but he made sure to use his microphone and other things without making too much noise. Timmy reversed his learning and became a better singer and dancer.
