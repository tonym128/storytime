Once upon a time, there was a big tree. The tree had many long branches. One day, a little boy named Tim found a rake under the tree. The rake was small and perfect for Tim.
Tim liked to play with the rake. He would rake leaves and make a big pile. Then, he would jump into the leaves and laugh. Tim liked to see the leaves fly in the air.
One day, Tim found a big book under the tree. The book had many pages. Tim liked to read the pages. He read the book every day under the big tree. Tim and the big tree were very happy.
