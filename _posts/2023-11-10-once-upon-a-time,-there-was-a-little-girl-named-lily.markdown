Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the garden with her toys. One day, she saw a big, tall sunflower. It was so tall that it almost touched the sky. 
Lily's friend, a little boy named Jack, came to play with her. They both stared at the sunflower. "Wow, it's so pretty!" said Jack. 
Lily was curious and asked Jack, "What is that big flower called?" 
"It's a sunflower," Jack replied. "My dad told me it's famous because it's the biggest sunflower in the garden." 
Lily was amazed and wanted to pick the sunflower. But Jack said, "No, we shouldn't pick it. It's important to leave it in the garden so it can keep growing and making it even bigger and more beautiful." 
So, Lily and Jack continued to play in the garden, enjoying the sunflower's beauty and the beauty it had to offer.
