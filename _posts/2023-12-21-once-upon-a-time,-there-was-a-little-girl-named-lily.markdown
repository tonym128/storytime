Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the beach with her mommy and daddy. One day, while playing in the sand, she saw a crab. The crab had smooth skin and was walking sideways. 
Lily wanted to hold the crab, so she asked her mommy, "Can I hold the crab, please?" 
Her mommy said, "Be careful, Lily. Crabs can pinch. You should hold it gently." 
Lily reached out her hand and held the crab. She felt its smooth shell and gently squeezed it. The crab didn't pinch her and Lily giggled with joy. 
From that day on, Lily always remembered to be careful when holding crabs. She loved going to the beach even more because she knew she could hold a crab and feel how smooth its skin was.
