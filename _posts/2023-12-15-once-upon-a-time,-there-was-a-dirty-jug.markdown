Once upon a time, there was a dirty jug. The dirty jug lived in a small house with a boy named Tim. Tim wanted to improve the jug and make it clean and shiny. So, he took the jug outside to wash it.
As Tim was washing the dirty jug, a magic frog jumped out of it. The frog said, "Thank you for cleaning me, Tim! I will give you a wish. What do you want?" Tim thought for a moment and said, "I wish that my jug will never be dirty again!"
The magic frog smiled and said, "Your wish is granted!" Suddenly, the dirty jug became clean, but it was no longer round! It had turned into a big, round ball that could roll. Tim was surprised, but he liked the ball even more than the jug. From that day on, Tim played with his new ball all the time, and he and the magic frog became best friends.
