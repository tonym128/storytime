Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved to play outside in the park. One day, he found a glove on the ground. It was a big glove, and it looked very strange. Timmy asked his friend, "Can you help me find the owner of this glove? It's unknown whose it is." 
His friend said, "Sure, let's go ask the people in the park if they lost a glove." They walked around and asked everyone they saw if they lost a glove. But nobody said they lost it. 
Suddenly, Timmy's friend saw a man walking towards them. He shouted, "Excuse me, sir! Is this your glove?" The man looked at the glove and said, "Yes! That's my glove! Thank you so much for finding it." Timmy and his friend were very happy to help the man. They marched back home, feeling proud of themselves for being kind to someone who lost their glove.
