Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his blocks and build tall towers. One day, Timmy's big sister Sarah came over to play. "What are you building, Timmy?" she asked. "I'm building a big tower," Timmy replied.
As Timmy was building his tower, he accidentally knocked over a cup of juice. "Oh no!" he cried. "I'm sorry, Sarah." "It's okay, Timmy," Sarah said. "Let's clean it up." They used a towel to wipe up the juice and then went back to building the tower.
Suddenly, they noticed that there was a leak in the tower. "Oh no!" Timmy said. "We have to fix it." Sarah helped Timmy wrap his hands around the tower and they used some glue to put it back together. "We did it!" Timmy said, feeling proud of their tower.
"That was a fun day," Sarah said. "Let's build something else tomorrow!" Timmy smiled and said, "Okay!" They hugged each other and went inside for dinner
