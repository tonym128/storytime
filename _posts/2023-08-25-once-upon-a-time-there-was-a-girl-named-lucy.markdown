Once upon a time there was a girl named Lucy. She was very independent and liked to do things on her own. One day, Lucy was playing with her toys, when she started to feel like she had to sneeze. So, she put her hands on her nose and tapped them. 
Suddenly, her mom appeared. "What are you doing, Lucy?" she asked. 
Lucy smiled and said, "I was sneezing!" 
Her mom laughed and said, "That's great, dear! Keep playing." 
So Lucy went back to her toys, feeling very independent. But she soon forgot all about her sneeze. Later on, she went to the park and was having so much fun!
