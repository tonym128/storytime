One day, a yellow bird and a green frog were talking. The yellow bird said, "I like you because you are green!" The green frog was happy and said, "I like you too, yellow bird! Let's be friends!"
The next day, the green frog saw a big, yellow sun in the sky. The green frog thought, "I want to be yellow like the sun!" So, the green frog tried to pull himself out of the water. He pulled and pulled, but he could not get out.
The yellow bird saw the green frog trying to pull himself out. The yellow bird said, "I will help you, green frog!" The yellow bird pulled and pulled, and finally, the green frog came out of the water. The green frog was so happy! But then, something unexpected happened.
The green frog turned into a prince! The prince said, "Thank you, yellow bird! You helped me! I was stuck in a frog body!" The yellow bird and the prince became best friends. They played together every day and were always happy.
