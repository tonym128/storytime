Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and watch cartoons. One day, her mom told her that they were going on a trip to visit her grandma. Lily got very excited and started to pack her favorite toys.
When they arrived at grandma's house, Lily saw a big box in the living room. She asked her grandma what was inside, but her grandma said it was a surprise. Lily couldn't wait to find out what was inside the box.
Later that day, grandma finally opened the box and pulled out a book. It was a very nice book with lots of colorful pictures. Grandma read it to Lily and they both enjoyed it very much. At the end of the story, grandma said, "Let's measure how much fun we had today!" Lily didn't really understand what that meant, but she was happy to hear that they had a fun day together.
