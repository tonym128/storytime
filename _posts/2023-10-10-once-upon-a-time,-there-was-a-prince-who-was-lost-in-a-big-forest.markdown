Once upon a time, there was a prince who was lost in a big forest. He was nervous and didn't know what to do. Suddenly, he saw a little girl walking towards him. 
"Hello, little girl," said the prince. "Can you help me find my way out of this forest?"
"Yes, I can help you," said the little girl. "But first, let's kiss and make a wish."
The prince and the little girl kissed each other on the cheek. Then, they walked together through the forest. 
After a while, they found a kind old man who helped them find the way out of the forest. The prince was very happy and thanked the little girl and the old man for their help. 
The moral of the story is that sometimes we need to ask for help and be kind to others, just like the little girl and the prince did.
