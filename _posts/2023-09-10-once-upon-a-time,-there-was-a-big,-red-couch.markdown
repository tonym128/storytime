Once upon a time, there was a big, red couch. It was in a room where many kids liked to play. One day, a little boy named Tim and his friend, Sue, were playing near the couch. They were running around and laughing.
"Stop!" said Tim. "We need to be careful near the couch." Sue looked at Tim and said, "Okay, let's play on the floor." They played happily on the floor, but then they heard a strange noise.
The noise came from the couch! They stopped and listened carefully. Tim and Sue were scared, but they wanted to know what was making the noise. They slowly walked closer to the couch and looked inside. To their surprise, they found a little, lost kitten! The kitten was scared too, but Tim and Sue were kind to it. They took the kitten out of the couch and played with it all day long. The kitten became their new friend, and they all lived happily ever after.
