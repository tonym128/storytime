Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to walk in the park with her mommy. One day, as they were walking, they saw a big, colorful rainbow in the sky. Lily thought it was the prettiest thing she had ever seen.
Suddenly, they heard a loud noise. It was a big, scary monster! Lily was scared and didn't know what to do. But her mommy told her to be brave and stand tall. They decided to walk towards the monster to see if it was a friendly monster or a scary monster.
As they got closer, they saw that the monster was actually a big, friendly dog that had gotten lost in the park. Lily was so happy to find the dog and even more excited to give it a big hug. From that day on, Lily and the dog would walk in the park together and look for more colorful rainbows.
