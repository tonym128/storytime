Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big red ball that she loved to play with. One day, she kicked the ball so hard that it made a small hole in her shoe. Lily was sad because she didn't want to wear a hole in her shoe. 
Lily's mom saw her sad face and asked her what was wrong. Lily showed her the hole in her shoe and her mom told her not to worry. She took out a needle and thread and sewed the hole shut. Lily was happy again because her shoe was fixed and she could wear it again. 
Later that day, Lily's mom gave her a cookie that was the perfect fit for her little hands. Lily smiled and took a big bite. She was happy to have a tasty cookie to eat.
