Once upon a time, there was a jolly little boy named Tim. He loved to play with his toy cars and trucks. One day, Tim's mother told him they needed to go to the store to buy some groceries.
Tim was excited to go on an adventure with his mother. As they walked to the store, Tim realized he forgot his favorite toy car at home. He started to cry and told his mother he wanted his car back.
His mother hugged him and said they could go back home to get the object. Tim felt happy again and thanked his mother for being so kind. When they got home, Tim grabbed his toy car and they continued on their fun adventure together.
