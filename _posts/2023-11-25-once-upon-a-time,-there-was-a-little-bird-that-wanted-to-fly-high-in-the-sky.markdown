Once upon a time, there was a little bird that wanted to fly high in the sky. One day, the little bird tried and tried to fly but it couldn't. It felt sad and wished it could fly like the other birds. 
Then, a little girl came along and saw the bird. She asked the bird why it was sad and the bird told her about its dream to fly high in the sky. The little girl felt sorry for the bird and said she would help it. 
She took the bird to her room and made it comfortable with a soft bed and yummy food. She also made a little pilot out of a plane to help the bird fly. The bird was so happy and felt like it was flying. It thanked the little girl and flew away into the blue sky.
