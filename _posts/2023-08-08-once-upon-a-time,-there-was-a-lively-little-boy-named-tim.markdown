Once upon a time, there was a lively little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play with his toy, a big magnet. One day, Tim went to the store with his mom. At the store, they saw a lot of toys. Tim was very happy.
Tim's mom said, "You can pick one toy, Tim." But Tim saw his big magnet and wanted it. He said, "Mom, can I have the magnet?" His mom looked at the magnet and said, "Yes, Tim. Let's buy the magnet."
Tim and his mom went to pay for the magnet. But Tim did not want to pay. He wanted the magnet. So, Tim took the magnet and ran out of the store. His mom was very angry and sad.
The next day, Tim went to play with his magnet. But it was not fun anymore. It was lost because Tim did not pay for it. Tim cried and wished he had listened to his mom. The end.
