Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a helpful girl named Amy. She liked to help everyone. One day, she found a hidden symbol on the ground. The symbol was a big, shiny star. Amy knew the star was special.
Amy showed the symbol to her friend, Tom. "Look, Tom!" she said. "I found a special star. Do you think it's magic?" Tom thought for a moment. "Maybe," he said, "but we should be careful with it."
Amy and Tom decided to keep the star safe, but they didn't know that the star was magical. One day, when they were playing near the woods, the star began to glow. Suddenly, Tom picked it up and a big, friendly giant appeared.
The giant thanked Amy and Tom for finding his lost symbol. He had lost it in the woods while he was playing. As a thank you gift, the giant gave both Amy and Tom a magic wand. From that day on, they could help even more people with their new magic wand. And they lived happily ever after.
